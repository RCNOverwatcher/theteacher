                            We have seen that the way a user interacts with a
                            computer is known as the 'user interface'. It is
                            also commonly called the 'Human-Computer Interface',
                            or HCI. Communication is two-way. The user must get
                            information into the computer using appropriate
                            methods and devices and the computer must send back
                            data and information to the user. If you want to
                            discuss fully the HCI, you need to discuss:

                            There are a range of software interfaces that could
                            be used; forms, menus, GUIs, command line and
                            natural language. When an interface (the input and
                            output hardware and the software methods) is being
                            designed for a new situation, the designer must run
                            through a checklist of things to consider. If this
                            is not done properly, the interface may be
                            cumbersome to use. It may not allow the user to get
                            the right information into the computer easily,
                            efficiently and effectively. If the wrong
                            information is put into the computer, any processing
                            will be invalid because it will be based on
                            inappropriate data. A poorly designed interface may
                            output confusing data and this will diminish a
                            user's understanding of it. They may not be able to
                            make sense of it and so it will be of limited value.
                            What sort of things should be on the designer's
                            checklist? The following list is not exhaustive but
                            does attempt to give you some ideas of the questions
                            that need to be asked.

                            If a user has a disability, that will affect the
                            selection of input devices needed, the style of the
                            software interface as well as the nature of the
                            output devices. Someone with a visual impairment may
                            appreciate audio output. Someone with restricted
                            mobility may need a concept keyboard or a natural
                            language input method, for example.

                            The age of the users is important. Clearly, the
                            interface for a three year old will be different to
                            an adult. For one thing, the child may not be able
                            to read any but the most basic words and will
                            therefore not be in a position to make selections
                            based on written instructions. A QWERTY keyboard
                            will be of limited use while a concept keyboard may
                            be a much better choice.

                            The experience of a user will also be important.
                            Many people have grown up with computers and will be
                            comfortable with a GUI. Others with a little more
                            experience may be happy to use a command line
                            interface. Some users may have had little
                            opportunity on computers and need a very basic menu
                            system and touch screen, just to persuade them to
                            even use the system!

                            If it is trying to simulate flying a plane, then a
                            joystick and pedals should be provided as input
                            devices. If it is simulating driving a car then a
                            steering wheel would be an appropriate input device.
                            A process control system may need pushbuttons,
                            keypads and selector switches so that a system can
                            be told what situation to aim for and how to achieve
                            it. If the system is seeking to entertain or be as
                            realistic as possible then special effects in the
                            shape of a vibrating steering wheel or sound effects
                            may help, for example. If the system were a
                            real-time simulation then a realistic visual
                            depiction of the world would be appropriate on a
                            suitable screen. If the application were to monitor
                            and control the flow of trains in and out of a train
                            station, for example, then a diagrammatic depiction
                            of the current situation, regularly refreshed, would
                            be an appropriate method of output, perhaps using
                            indicator lights. If the application were to monitor
                            and control the flow of water around some pipes,
                            there would be a need for sensors to continuously
                            monitor the flow and pressure of water and feed
                            these back to the computer. There would also be a
                            need for actuators (any computer-controlled devices
                            that cause movement) to adjust valves and switch
                            pumps on and off, thereby adjusting water flows.
                            Again, a diagrammatic depiction on a large VDU or
                            other large display unit would be necessary to show
                            the operators the current situation.

                            If it is a dirty, dusty place, a membrane keyboard
                            or a touch screen may be necessary to prevent the
                            keyboard quickly becoming unusable. If any systems
                            are critical, for example, in nuclear reactors, then
                            the use of klaxons may be necessary to signal the
                            urgency of a situation to users. A hospital, which
                            has patients on life support, may use a similar
                            system or flashing indicator lights to alert nurses
                            to a problem with a patient. If the system is to be
                            used in an office to enter in information from paper
                            forms then a QWERTY keyboard or natural language may
                            be fine, in conjunction with forms-based input
                            screens. Simple laser-jet or ink-jet printers may
                            suffice for most office-type applications. However,
                            if large, accurate engineering drawings are needed
                            using colour, then a plotter may be selected as the
                            output device. If the system was to be used under
                            water then any input devices such as sensors should
                            be waterproof and corrosion-resistant. If it was to
                            be used in the open air, similar consideration
                            should be given to any environmental factors that
                            may affect system components.

                              If the information is to be used at the computer
                              system, it may only be necessary to provide a
                              'standard' VDU. Of course, engineering design
                              applications may warrant the purchase of a 21-inch
                              screen, for example. If the information is to be
                              sent to someone or hardcopy is required for legal
                              reasons then a printer will have to be selected.
                              In a warehouse environment, a printer may be
                              needed so that an order can be printed off and
                              taken by the warehouseman around the warehouse

                            There are many common elements to the design of good

                            navigation interfaces, an interface for an

                              proceed with an action and needs you to give it
                              some details. It pops up a dialogue box for you to
                              fill in. These are usually designed to be very
                              quick and easy to fill in. For example, you might
                              want to print out some work. You go FILE then
                              PRINT and a dialogue box appears. It might look
                              something like this:</span

                                  entering data than e.g. keyboards. They also

                                  checking that the sensible data you have
                                  entered is actually the data you want, perhaps
                                  by double-checking it).

                              to be able to justify why you have designed every
                              part of it in the way you have. One method of
                              doing this on paper and in an exam and for your
                              coursework is to sketch out the design and then
                              annotate it. You should circle features on the
                              form, draw a line to the side of the form where
                              there is some space to write and then say why you
                              have done what you did! One key phrase to use in
                              your annotated comments is 'so that'. Here's an
                              example.</span
