                            ><br />
                            There are many common elements to the design of good
                            interfaces, whether they are for data input forms,
                            navigation interfaces, an interface for an
                            application, web sites and web forms or dialogue
                            boxes or indeed data capture forms and reports. In
                            this section, we will document the features of these
                            items with a view to designing our own.

                            A data capture form is a paper-based form used to
                            capture information. It is then given to a data
                            input operator to type in, using a data input form
                            on the computer. For example, if a new pupil joined
                            the school, their parents may be given a data
                            capture form, requesting details such as their
                            child's full name, address, emergency contact
                            details and so on. Once completed, they return the
                            form to the school. The school secretary or someone
                            else in the Admin Department would then transfer the
                            details from the paper form to the school's computer
                            system. Don't confuse the data capture form with the
                            data input form! The former is paper-based. The
                            latter is on the computer. It makes sense to design
                            the data capture form so that it mirrors the data
                            input form. That will make data entry much faster.

                            Good input form design is important for a number of
                            reasons.

                                  scroll bar. For example, if you were ordering

                                  on the screen showing you the terms and
                                  conditions. This ensures that much of the

                                  take up a lot of space. Tick boxes, radio
                                  buttons and combo boxes are faster ways of
                                  entering data than e.g. keyboards. They also

                                  checking that the sensible data you have

                                  together, while the options in the 'Select

                                  example. Logical groupings are often
                                  reinforced by drawing boxes around groups or
                                  by selection of colours and shading to 'raise'
                                  or 'sink' an area from the rest of the form

                                  For example, you could have used radio buttons
                                  to allow a user to select how to be contacted.
                                  If they select 'By telephone', a little icon

                                  selected so they work together and they're
                                  easy on the eyes. Some combinations work well

                                  Internet. Discuss what keywords you could try
                                  and then do a search. The usual rule of thumb
                                  is that no more than three colours should be
                                  used or else you're in danger of the form
                                  looking a mess!

                                  you could put an 'Are you sure you want to

                            A special type of input form is a dialogue box. This
                            is any window that appears because you have to make
                            selections from choices. An application or utility
                            wants to know how to proceed with an action and
                            needs you to give it some details. It pops up a
                            dialogue box for you to fill in. These are usually
                            designed to be very quick and easy to fill in. For
                            example, you might want to print out some work. You
                            go FILE then PRINT and a dialogue box appears. It
                            might look something like this:

                                then annotate it. You should circle features on
                                the form, draw a line to the side of the form
                                where there is some space to write and then say
                                why you have done what you did! One key phrase
                                to use in your annotated comments is 'so that'.

                              data shouldn't be too close to each other, or the
                              data will be confusing.</span
