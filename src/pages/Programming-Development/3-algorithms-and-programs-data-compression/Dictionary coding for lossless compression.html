                            Dictionary coding for lossless compression
                          </h1>
                          <p>
                            <strong>Introduction</strong><br />In 'lossless
                            compression', the codecs keep all of the information
                            about a file. The compressed file, once
                            decompressed, can be reconstructed so it is exactly
                            like the file before it was compressed, with no loss
                            of any information at all.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The general idea behind dictionary encoding is
                            fairly simple. Consider a book which has pages in it
                            pages, each one with text on.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            We could create a dictionary of words and phrases
                            that are used in the book, and each of these words
                            and phrases has its own reference. Wherever a
                            particular word or phrase is used on a page, we
                            substitute it with the code in the dictionary for
                            that word or phrase. The word, 'compressed' for
                            example, takes 10 bytes to store, 1 for each
                            character in the word. If we substitute it for a two
                            byte reference to the word, then we can store the
                            word 'compressed' in only 2 bytes. There will be an
                            overhead, however â€“ we need to store the actual
                            dictionary and the references but overall, there
                            will be a saving. This system isn't just about text
                            files, which are just codes, remember. This can be
                            applied to any data file.

                            <strong>LZ77</strong><br />There are a range of
                            compression algorithms that use the basic idea
                            described above. Some encoding algorithms have a
                            dictionary already built or built up as part of the
                            initialisation process before compression begins,
                            such as 'Huffman coding'. Others create a dictionary
                            that changes as part of the compression process.
                            LZ77 is an example of this. You start off by having
                            a storage area called a buffer. This is going to be
                            looking at the file you want to compress. The buffer
                            is split into two, one area holding the start of the
                            dictionary and one area holding the part of the file
                            that you are trying to compress.

                          <p>
                            What the compression algorithm does is to take
                            whatever is in the 'looking ahead buffer' area and
                            it tries to find a match in the dictionary. When a
                            match is found, a 'token' is generated. If it can't
                            find a match, it can great one and add it to the
                            dictionary. The token generated is a three part
                            piece of data that gives:
                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type: none">
                              <ul>
                                <li>
                                  the position in the dictionary where the match
                                  occurred
                                </li>
                                <li>the length of the match in characters</li>
                                <li>the next character.</li>
                              </ul>
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>
                            For example, 450, 18, f means that the phrase in the
                            looking ahead buffer matches the dictionary at
                            position number 450, the match continues for 18
                            characters and the first character in the looking
                            ahead buffer after the match fails is f.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            This token is then added to the compressed file
                            which is being built. The compressed file will
                            simply be a stream of such tokens, which can later
                            be decompressed when needed. For example, this token
                            can be decompressed by going to position 450 in the
                            dictionary, getting back the 18 characters from that
                            position and then adding the letter f to the end.
