                            ><br />The same person in a team may work on one
                            particular document at many different times. They
                            may work on one document in the office, back it up
                            on a pen drive, take it home and then work on it
                            there. There are now two different versions of the
                            same document. If they forget the pen drive in the
                            morning, and then go to work, take a copy of the
                            work-based document and then carry on working on the
                            document using that version at work, you now have a
                            very confusing set of different versions of the same
                            document, none of which have all of the latest
                            information on! If you then add to that, the fact
                            that a<span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px"

                              members in a team, sometimes hundreds of different
                              people and sometimes scattered across the world,
                              you can see that, all producing a variety of
                              different documents and all sharing documents with
                              other members of the team, you can see that there
                              is a potential problem. It is very easy for a team
                              member to be working on something but be using
                              information from out-of-date documents. This
                              applies particularly to software teams producing a
                              software product.</span

                            ><br />Because of the problems associated with the
                            production of different versions of software,
                            companies have clear procedures on how code
                            production will be controlled. This is called
                            'version management' and everyone involved in any
                            particular project has a responsibility to follow
                            the procedures. The procedures will typically
                            specify:

                            As different versions of the same section of code
                            are produced, they start to form a set of back-ups,
                            which can be used to roll back a project to an
                            earlier version if necessary, or to recover some
                            code that has been lost for some reason.&nbsp;

                            ><br />There are different techniques in use when
                            more than one programmer needs to work on the same
                            block of code. The most common method used is that a
                            programmer 'checks out' and temporarily 'owns' a
                            programming file. They then have the right to open,
                            view, edit and delete the contents of the file.
                            Other programmers can access the file but they only
                            have the right to open and view the file. They can
                            only open, view, edit and delete the contents once
                            they have checked it in, when the other programmer
                            has finished and released the file for someone else
                            to use.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            More tricky is a system where two people can check
                            out and work on the same file at the same time. When
                            they have finished, the changes from both files are
                            merged. This is not a perfect science and really
                            only useful for simple text-based documents, not
                            code. What a programmer can do is to take their own
                            copy of some code temporarily, and then manually
                            merge it to the file when the other programmer has
                            finished making any of their changes.

                            <strong>School projects</strong><br />When you start
                            any project at school, you should always have a
                            system for version control, to ensure that you can
                            never lose more than 30 minutes of your work. If
                            something catastrophic happens, such as the hard
                            drive on you computer at home completely fails, or
                            your laptop is stolen, or you spill coffee into your
                            laptop and it stops working, or you lose your pen
                            drive, for example, you can always recover the work
                            you have already done. A very simple version control
                            strategy that you can employ is to always include
                            the date in the file name. If you are working on a
                            document over many days or weeks, then open it up
                            and re-save it immediately with the date in the file
                            name and use that version, not the original. In this
                            way, you will start to create a set of versions you
                            can use if necessary. For example:
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Evaluation 21/09/15<br />Evaluation 22/09/15<br />Evaluation
                            26/09/15<br />Evaluation 30/09/15
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Then save it every 30 minutes you are working on it
                            onto a pen drive.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <strong>Cloud storage</strong><br />An even better
                            strategy is to store your work onto cloud storage
                            and use the version there. Most companies offering
                            cloud storage such as Dropbox will automatically
                            back-up your work for you and keep different
                            versions of the same document as you make them. You
                            can then roll back or recover documents whenever you
                            have to. Sometimes, this is time-limited, unless you
                            pay a fee. It is almost impossible to lose work as
                            it is kept encrypted and on different servers across
                            the world. Of course, there is always the danger of
                            a hacker causing damage, a rogue employee stealing
                            or deleting data or the company going bankrupt
                            overnight.&nbsp;
