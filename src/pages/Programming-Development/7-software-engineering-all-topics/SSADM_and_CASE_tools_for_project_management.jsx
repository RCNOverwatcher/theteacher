                                How does a Project Manager go about managing a
                                project? She will almost certainly use a project
                                methodology! Methodologies are formal ways of
                                doing things. SSADM is a project management
                                methodology. According to the British Computing
                                Society's&nbsp;'A Glossary of Computing Terms',
                                SSADM is "a standard method of analysis and
                                design of large-scale software packages used
                                within Government departments in the UK". It has
                                been used in a wide range of project situations.

                                <strong>Why SSADM helps projects</strong>
                                <br />
                                SSADM helps structure a project into manageable
                                chunks. It breaks the project down into a very
                                clear set of stages. This facilitates better
                                estimation, management and control of costs and
                                time. For each stage, there are well-defined
                                activities that&nbsp;must take place. For each
                                activity, there are clear deliverables that must
                                be produced (diagrams that must be produced,
                                letters that must be written and signed, lists
                                and so on). All the required deliverables must
                                be completed and signed off before the
                                next&nbsp;stage in a project can start.
                                Deliverables (for example Data Flow Diagrams,
                                Entity Life Histories and E-R diagrams) are
                                produced to tightly defined standards that
                                ensure they are precise and clear to all. If any
                                change takes place in the project,
                                for&nbsp;example, the customer adds an extra
                                feature to the project then there are clear
                                procedures and paperwork that must accompany any
                                change. SSADM promotes teamwork because
                                employees are all using the same methodology.
                                CASE tools are commonly&nbsp;used to aid SSADM.
                                These are discussed later in this section.

                                  The difference between SSADM and a project
                                  life cycle
                                </strong>

                                We have already examined the project life cycle
                                in the Systems Development Life Cycle chapter. A
                                project was found to have distinct stages. One
                                way to summarise the stages (but not the only
                                way) is to split them up under the headings:
                                Feasibility study, Systems analysis, Design,
                                Implementation (of the design), Testing,
                                Installation and Maintenance.&nbsp;SSADM is very
                                closely related to the project life cycle model
                                shown above. There are some differences,
                                however. For example, there is no SSADM stage
                                that relates directly to the 'Implementation'
                                stage in the life cycle. Having said that, many
                                of the&nbsp;activities in SSADM can be mapped to
                                the project life cycle. Certainly, many of the
                                activities and documents produced in the project
                                life cycle (which we have already discussed)
                                appear as part of the SSADM methodology. SSADM
                                can be summarised as&nbsp;comprising of the
                                following stages: Feasibility study,
                                Requirements analysis, Requirements
                                specification, Logical design and Physical
                                design.

                                <strong>SSADM and CASE tools</strong>
                                <br />
                                We have already said that SSADM is a methodical
                                approach to project development. It splits up
                                projects into stages. It lays down rules about
                                what must be done in each stage. Documentation
                                is tightly defined and cross-checking and
                                cross-referencing&nbsp;is a key feature of this
                                approach. The approach of SSADM makes it an
                                ideal target for computer programs. Why not
                                write a program that allows a Project Manager to
                                manage the stages in SSADM on computer? A
                                program that does this is known as a&nbsp;CASE
                                (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tool and
                                there are various CASE tools on the market, such
                                as SELECT SSADM.&nbsp;CASE tools help Project
                                Managers using a methodology such as SSADM in
                                many ways. These include the following:
                              </p>
                              <ul>
                                <li style="list-style-type: none">
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>
                                      Templates are pre-defined. This promotes
                                      standard documents and cuts down the time
                                      to produce documents such as a DFD. In
                                      addition, standard naming conventions are
                                      used across all documents.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      Not only are documents pre-defined but
                                      also one document can be used to start off
                                      another document. For example, when a DFD
                                      level zero diagram (the context diagram)
                                      is drawn, the start of the level o ne
                                      diagram is automatically generated with
                                      the correct number of data flows into and
                                      out of the system.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      Cross-checking can take place. If someone
                                      makes a change in one document then the
                                      CASE tool can flag up where any changes
                                      should be made in other documents.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      If a Project Manager leaves a project then
                                      another will take over. By using an
                                      'industry standard' methodology it should
                                      be easy for a new manager to take over. If
                                      the new manager had to pick up a project
                                      that followed an unfamiliar methodology,
                                      it would take time to learn.

                                One particularly effective technique at the
                                disposal of a systems analyst/designer is the
                                use of prototyping. This is where a designer
                                makes a simplified version of a program to
                                illustrate how the final product might look and
                                feel. A prototype may show&nbsp;a customer or
                                others in a design team what input screens might
                                be present, what the reports may look like and
                                what functions would be available. Many of the
                                features may not work but it is a very good way
                                of illustrating to a customer what
                                the&nbsp;designers are think of. You may well
                                use this approach for parts of coursework! There
                                are often marks available in coursework for
                                considering different approaches and showing
                                good user involvement. What better way of
                                providing evidence of these things than a number
                                of prototypes! Once you have decided and
                                justified a particular approach, you can then
                                refine it in the&nbsp;light of feedback from
                                your customer. Prototyping could be used to help
                                you develop a Requirements Specification. It
                                could also be used in the design section, to
                                involve the user in the final ‘look’ and ‘feel’
                                of the product. The prototyping approach
                                is&nbsp;also known as the Rapid Application
                                Development methodology. The benefits of this
                                approach can be summarised as follows:
                              </p>

                                      of prototypes.

                                      Prototyping can help in the production of
                                      a clear Requirements Specification because
                                      it can be used as an aid to discussion.
                                      This is especially true when technical
                                      people and non-technical people need
                                      to&nbsp;communicate together. The final
                                      specification can be refined through
                                      discussion and feedback.

                                      involve the user in the product at all
                                      stages, for example, in the detail of how
                                      a report will be laid out. Involving your
                                      user as much as possible is a good way of
                                      ensuring that&nbsp;mistakes or 'nasty
                                      surprises' in the end product don't happen
                                      because your user will be able to
                                      highlight them with you at one of your
                                      regular meetings.

                                      It's possible, of course, that the
                                      prototypes you put together one afternoon
                                      will give your customer the wrong idea of
                                      how long it will take to do the final
                                      product! For example, it might only take
                                      an afternoon to put together some input
                                      screens with&nbsp;function buttons on them
                                      in Access. Actually coding up the function
                                      buttons so they carry out the functions
                                      they're supposed to may involve weeks of
                                      design, coding and testing!

                                Projects can quickly become complicated. Even
                                small projects can suffer if they are not
                                approached in the right way. It is important,
                                therefore, that a systematic approach be
                                adopted. This involves ensuring that complete
                                and up-to-date&nbsp;documentation is kept at all
                                stages of a project. It means that projects
                                should be methodical and calculated and should
                                flow naturally from one stage to the next.
                                Project Managers should ensure that those
                                working on projects are not tempted to
                                start&nbsp;parts of a project prematurely.
                                Regular reviews should take place and checks
                                should be made to ensure that different parts of
                                a project and different documents are consistent
                                with each other. This is especially important
                                when changes are made.

                                System designers use documents. Documents are
                                useful tools for a number of reasons. They
                                summarise data, bringing it together into a
                                compact form. Diagrams aid understanding. A
                                designer can visualise what is happening in a
                                Data Flow&nbsp;Diagram, for example, a lot
                                easier than a number of written down steps.
                                Diagrams act as a discussion tool between team
                                members. A first-draft E-R Diagram, for example,
                                can be used in a meeting to discuss whether it
                                is the best design for a project&nbsp;or to see
                                if anything has been missed out. Documents can
                                be used to help a new team member pick up a
                                project in the middle of it. Technical documents
                                can go in the Technical Manual. If system
                                maintenance is needed in the future then they
                                will greatly&nbsp;assist whoever is doing the
                                maintenance. The design team can use diagrams
                                when they meet customers. Customers are not
                                designers and designers do not know the
                                customer's business as well as the customer
                                does. Diagrams can help bring the&nbsp;customer
                                and designers together. They can have a
                                discussion around a diagram that they all can
                                understand.

                                There are many pressures on projects. There are
                                pressures from managers to meet deadlines and
                                costs. There are pressures from&nbsp;the
                                customer to get the job done with all the
                                functions that they need. Each member of a
                                design team has their own pressures.&nbsp;For
                                example, a database designer will be keen to get
                                on and design. An analyst will want to
                                investigate the system. Examples of&nbsp;the
                                problems that could occur in a project are
                                below.

                                      what they want, you won't know what to
                                      make!

                                      changing their mind later on? If&nbsp;you
                                      have spent many hundreds of hours
                                      designing a database and then the customer

                                      what is needed? If there is little design,

                                structure the project and provide everyone with
                                clear guidelines and rules. It will clearly
                                define the deliverables at each project stage
                                and ensure that stages do not start before the
                                appropriate time.

                                Before the next stage is started, however,
                                deliverables need to be checked against the
                                previous stages, to ensure that they marry up to
                                previous stages' deliverables. For example:

                                      Naming conventions need to be established
                                      and maintained otherwise different names
                                      will be given to the same piece of data
                                      across different documents, resulting in
                                      confusion.
                                    </li>

                                It is clear from above that the documents and
                                tasks that produce those documents are all in
                                fact related in one way or another. If they are
                                related then they can and should be
                                cross-checked. This is especially true when a
                                design change takes place and one of&nbsp;the
                                documents has a small change made to it - other
                                documents will now not be 'consistent' with the
                                document that has just been changed. Every time
                                a change happens, all the other relevant
                                documents should be cross-checked.
                                Cross-checking is a&nbsp;valuable way of
                                ensuring that errors don't creep into projects.
                                Correcting small errors can be very expensive if
                                they are done after a project is completed. The
                                use of CASE tools makes cross-checking
                                relatively effortless!

                                <strong>Managing projects</strong>
                                <br />
                                Effective project management is important for a
                                number of reasons. Overrunning a project can
                                cost a company millions of pounds. There are
                                also many people involved with projects, both
                                people within a company and contractors. Their
                                time must be&nbsp;booked in advance. It must
                                also be paid for. If the times when they are
                                needed slip, those people may not be available.
                                They may be booked for other projects. This
                                could have major implications for getting a
                                project done on time and to budget.
                                A&nbsp;company may have to pay a premium to get
                                them or someone else in on short notice. If a
                                company needs to hire 6 trucks for the day on
                                Day 12 of a project and then they find out on
                                Day 11 that they can't use them until Day 15,
                                they may find that the trucks&nbsp;are
                                unavailable then. The project could slip or the
                                company may have to pay a premium to get what
                                they want at short notice. To manage a project
                                effectively, a Project Manager needs to be able
                                to break down a project into tasks, estimate how
                                long each task will take, how much each will
                                cost and the resources needed to complete each
                                task and to work out the
                                inter-dependencies&nbsp;between tasks. If they
                                don't know these things, it will be difficult
                                for them to manage a project effectively. When
                                you do a large computing project for your
                                course, you will have been told many times by
                                your teacher to plan your time carefully. You
                                may know from experience what happens when you
                                don't plan properly. Before you know it, you are
                                burning&nbsp;the midnight oil as deadlines
                                approach. You get stressed out and irritable and
                                your teacher appears not to care! All of this
                                because you didn't plan your work carefully at
                                the start of the project and didn't pick up time
                                problems early enough. When&nbsp;you don't plan
                                a project you get stressed. When a company
                                doesn't plan properly it can cost them millions
                                of pounds. Fortunately, there are some tools
                                available to help Project Managers manage
                                projects.&nbsp;
