                                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS
                                (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the main

                                and web pages. If they are combined with a
                                client-side processing language like JavaScript
                                to add dynamic and interactive content, then
                                websites can be built that are clear, memorable,
                                useful, informative, accessible, organised and
                                maintainable. This section deals with HTML.

                                A typical web page&nbsp;might contain text,
                                pictures, animation, movies and sound and
                                collectively, they are known as
                                multimedia.&nbsp;HTML is a computer language
                                whose purpose is to create multimedia pages on a
                                computer. The first page of a web site is called
                                the 'homepage'. Its file name is usually always
                                either index.html or index.htm and this is the
                                special file a server looks for first when you
                                request a web page. HTML is a mark-up language.
                                It is written as a script - a sequence of
                                instructions called tags that tell a web browser
                                how to display something. It is not a
                                programming language as such - it doesn't use
                                programming constructs such as SEQUENCE,
                                SELECTION and ITERATION. However, it is possible
                                to 'embed' a program written in e.g. JavaScript
                                into an HTML page to add some interactive
                                capabilities or add dynamic data.
                              </p>
                              <p class="NormalContent">
                                Many but not all HTML tags come in pairs. You
                                can view tags and pairs of tags by viewing the
                                HTML code of this page. For example, in
                                Explorer, go to VIEW - SOURCE. The tags are in
                                angled brackets. A web page has a HEAD and a
                                BODY. The information held in the HEAD isn't
                                displayed. It contains metadata, or the words a
                                search engine will use when indexing a page. The
                                BODY holds both the information to be displayed
                                and the tags needed by web browsers to decide
                                how to format the information. Carriage returns
                                and extra spaces are ignored in web browsers. If
                                you need to create spaces between words, or to
                                layout text in a certain way, there are many
                                tricks around. For example, you can use
                                'invisible' tables or white space pictures to
                                layout work, or space work out using the non
                                breaking space code.

                                <strong>Hotlinks</strong>
                                <br />
                                You can access web pages by typing in a URL in a
                                web browser. However, you can also access pages
                                by using hotlinks (also known as hyperlinks).
                                This is simply a technique used in HTML that
                                allows a reader on one web site to quickly
                                access other pages in the same web site, or on
                                other web sites, by clicking on a word or
                                picture that has been set up for that purpose.
                                It saves the user having to type in long URL
                                links, which is time-consuming and prone to
                                mistakes. Somebody who designs a large web site
                                will typically split up their site into a number
                                of pages. There will be the ‘homepage’, which is
                                the main, introductory page and then there will
                                be many other pages, each with some logically
                                grouped information on them. Connections between
                                each page in a web site will then be achieved
                                through the use of hotlinks.&nbsp;

                                <br />
                                Because HTML has been around for so long now,
                                there are thousands of excellent tutorials. The
                                trick is to find one that is both up-to-date
                                with the latest standards and in a style of
                                delivery that suits you. At the time of writing,
                                the latest version of HTML is HTML 5. The basic
                                core features of HTML have remained unchanged.
                                You can easily write HTML using any text editor
                                e.g. Notepad in Windows and any web broswer.
                                There are also HTML editors, which do the same
                                job as text editors but have additional features
                                that make writing and testing code that little
                                bit easier. Don't use any word processors, as
                                they make use of hidden codes in pages that can
                                make the production of HTML very messy and
                                problematic. You can find a list of HTML editors
