                                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS
                                (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the main
                                tools for designing and and displaying websites
                                and web pages. If they are combined with a
                                client-side processing language like JavaScript
                                to add dynamic and interactive content, then
                                websites can be built that are clear, memorable,
                                useful, informative, accessible, organised and
                                maintainable. This section deals with CSS.

                                The content of a web page and the instructions
                                that tell the browser how to layout the content
                                are divorced in well written websites. This is
                                achieved by writing two files for a web page.
                                The first file, called a Cascading Style Sheet,
                                or CSS file, holds the layout instructions that
                                tells a web browser how to layout any
                                information on the web page. It deals with
                                actual layout, the fonts to use, the size of the
                                fonts, the colours to use, how to lay out
                                tables, pictures and so on. The second file is
                                the HTML file. This file contains only the
                                content you want to display on a web page. You
                                can set up many different 'style sheets' and use
                                them at any time for any of your web pages. For
                                example, you might have some tags in a style
                                sheet that say "Display all headings in size 1,
                                underlined and red". If this style sheet is
                                applied to a web page then whenever it comes
                                across a piece of information that's a title, it
                                formats it according to the style sheetâ€™s
                                instructions. Style sheets in HTML are very
                                useful. Imagine, for example, you have written
                                100 pages of information, each with a green page
                                background. If you changed your mind and wanted
                                a blue background, you would only need to change
                                one page, the style sheet, instead of 100
                                individual pages! &nbsp;

                                Because CSS has been around for so long now,
                                there are thousands of excellent tutorials. Like
                                HTML, you can easily write CSWS using any text
                                editor e.g. Notepad in Windows and any web
                                broswer. There are also editors, which do the
                                same job as text editors but have additional
                                features that make writing and testing CSS code
                                that little bit easier. Don't use any word
                                processors, as they make use of hidden codes in
                                pages that can make the production of CSS very
                                messy and problematic. You can find many CSS
                                editors using Google:
