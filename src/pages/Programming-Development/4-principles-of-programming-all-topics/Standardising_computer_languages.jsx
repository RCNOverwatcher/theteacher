                                  apply. If they need to use some documentation
                                  to understand how to use a keyword, for
                                  example, they know that they can look up
                                  examples, look up the language documentation,
                                  seek help in places such as YouTube and the
                                  information they find there will apply to
                                  their particular situation. If someone was

                                  program, or using a version of a language that
                                  included non-standard instructions, it is
                                  quite likely that the documentation would not
                                  apply fully to a programmer's situation, and
                                  that could cause a lot of problems.

                                and international people, who have the right
                                level of knowledge and skills to do this. They
                                have to be respected and looked to, approachable
                                and willing to listen. They have to be able to
                                consult widely, distributing information and
                                collecting information globally in different
                                languages and be able to include and work with

                                across the world. They have to be able to track
                                documents and versions of documents so that the
                                development of a standard progresses
                                methodically. They have to be able to organise

                                sub-committees, who look into specialised areas

                                could upset a lot of people and lose a lot of
                                goodwill and participation. They have to be able
                                to look at different points of view and be able
                                to make clear decisions that are in the best
                                interests of developing the standard whilst at
                                the same time, respecting the history and spirit
                                of the language. They have to have the vision to
                                see how one decision can impact on other,
                                unforeseen areas, and be able to accept this
                                situation and deal with it logically,
                                unemotionally and methodically. Actually being

                                difficult thing to do. Methodologies such as
                                syntax diagrams and BNF help with some aspects,
                                but &nbsp;broader descriptions need to be

                                software and standards for getting languages
                                approved by certification bodies. They need to
                                ensure that the standard can develop in the
                                future and that there is a framework in place to
                                allow this to happen successfully. They need to
                                be aware of and take into account any regulatory
                                considerations, for example, getting the final
                                standard approved and accepted, initially
                                through some form of stress testing and quality
                                testing but ultimately, by presenting the
                                standard to a regulatory certification body for
                                approval. Such organisations include ISO, IEC,
                                ANSI and the BSI.

                                Several organisations exist to facilitate the
                                standardisation process. These include the
                                Organisation of Standards (ISO), the
                                International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
                                and the American National Standards Institute
                                (ANSI) and the British Standards Institute
                                (BSI). These bodies have the responsibility for
                                approving standards presented to them, or for
                                driving a standard forward so it is widely
                                accepted. They often have technical
                                sub-committees working for them so, for example,
                                the Technical Committee for Programming
                                Languages called X3J11 is a sub-committee of
                                ANSI. This sub-committee is responsible for
                                devising standards in programming languages,
                                which it then publishes for wider review.
                                Members of committees such as these can include
                                representatives from hardware manufacturers,
                                software designers, applications engineers,
                                university representatives and so on.

                                across the world goes into producing a
                                programming language like Python, something that
