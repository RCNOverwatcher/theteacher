                              These are possibly more straightforward to
                              understand than BNF notation. They are very useful
                              to the programmer because they can be used to
                              ensure that the correct syntax of instructions and
                              declarations, for example, are used.</span

                            Consider the BNF definition of a signed integer.
                            This is an unsigned integer with either a plus or a
                            minus in front of it.

                            but one way is as follows:

                            A signed integer could also be represented using a
                            syntax diagram. Again, there are different ways of
                            representing the same logic. Here is one way, using
                            2 diagrams.

                                >How do you read a syntax diagram?</span

                            ><br />
                            Always start reading the diagram from the left and
                            follow the flow to the right! You cannot go back on
                            yourself unless there is an arrow that lets you! The
                            first diagram defines a digit. Starting from the
                            left, you can flow to the right through only one of
                            a number of paths, and then out again. So, for
                            example, you may flow through the digit 7 and then
                            out again. You cannot backtrack because there isn’t
                            an arrow to take you back. Thus, a digit is made up
                            of only one number.
                          </p>
                          <p align="left">
                            The second diagram again must be read from left to
                            right. You have a choice how a signed integer can
                            begin, either with a plus or a minus sign. Then it
                            needs a digit. From the definition in the first
                            diagram, a digit is made up of one symbol. After one
                            symbol has been selected, the signed integer can
                            finish, or it can loop back on itself (because there
                            is an arrow that lets it do this) and collect
                            another digit, and so on, until the signed integer
                            is finished.

                            ><br />
                            Some further points to note. Some symbols are in
                            circles, like 0, 1, 2, + and so on. These are
                            <strong>terminal symbols</strong> and cannot be
                            broken down further by reference to other syntax
                            diagrams. Other symbols such as digit are in a
                            rectangular box. That means that you need to refer
                            to another syntax diagram to get the full
                            definition. This ensures that complicated syntax
                            diagrams can be produced which aren’t too cluttered.

                            the programming language Pascal, you could use an IF
                            construction in the following way:

                            or you might use an ELSE in the code, like this:
