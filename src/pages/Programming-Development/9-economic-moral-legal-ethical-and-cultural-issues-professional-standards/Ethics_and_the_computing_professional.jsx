                                    Computers are in a central role today and
                                    software engineers are at the heart of
                                    developing both new software and the new
                                    systems that the software will run on. They
                                    are in a very powerful position and can do a
                                    lot of good, as well as a lot of harm. They
                                    are also in a position to influence others
                                    to do good or to do harm. Because of their
                                    power, software engineers must work towards
                                    and be seen to be working towards being a
                                    force for good and working in a way that
                                    promotes their profession rather than brings
                                    it into suspicion.
