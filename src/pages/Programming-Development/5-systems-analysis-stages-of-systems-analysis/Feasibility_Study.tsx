                                The Feasibility Study
                              </h1>
                              <p>
                                After a company has made contact with a Systems
                                Analyst, the Systems Analyst will go into the
                                company and make a provisional study of the
                                problem. They will do this to decide if a
                                solution is possible, how it can be done and
                                whether it is a good idea to implement. This
                                study is known as a ‘feasibility study’. The
                                deliverable for this stage in the Systems Life
                                Cycle is the Feasibility Study Report. The
                                Systems Analyst will carry out a number of
                                tasks.
                              </p>

                                      They need to find out about the company
                                      and how it functions so that they can
                                      better understand and define both the
                                      problem and the context of the problem.
                                      Remember, the Systems Analyst doesn't know
                                      anything about the company yet, other than
                                      what they learnt in the first meeting.
                                      They need quickly to understand the
                                      business and its operations so that they
                                      can fully understand the nature of the
                                      problem.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      They need to investigate and then document
                                      the nature of the problem in some detail.
                                      This means that the Systems Analyst will
                                      do a scaled down 'systems analysis'. They
                                      might do some of the systems analysis
                                      tasks in 'outline detail'. You can read
                                      more about these actual tasks later, in
                                      the section on systems analysis.

                                      They need to identify, suggest and justify
                                      possible solutions. Often, a number of
                                      possible solutions are put forward to
                                      allow a choice to be made. The Systems
                                      Analyst will need to identify the benefits
                                      to the company of each possible solution
                                      put forward and how much each solution
                                      will cost the company. This is sometimes
                                      known as a ‘cost-benefit analysis’.

                                    <li>
                                      In addition to a cost-benefit analysis,
                                      the Systems Analyst will also identify a
                                      time scale for each proposed solution -
                                      how long each one would take to implement.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      They need to identify any legal, moral or
                                      ethical considerations in the possible
                                      solutions.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      They need to identify any implications for
                                      the company. This could include
                                      identifying any new skills that the
                                      workforce will need, identifying any
                                      changes in the way the company will do
                                      business, identifying any changes in the
                                      way customers will interact with the
                                      business and Health and Safety issues, for
                                      example.
                                    </li>
                                  </ul>
                                </li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>
                                The Systems Analyst will carry out the above
                                tasks and produce a report called the
                                Feasibility Report. They will then present this
                                written report to the company and may also do a
                                presentation of their findings. This report will
                                be the document that the company uses to decide
                                whether or not to proceed with the project.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Two outcomes are possible. The company can
                                decide not to go ahead with the project, perhaps
                                because a solution is more expensive or more
                                disruptive than they thought. Or they can decide
                                to go ahead with a solution. If they decide to
                                go ahead, they need first to select the solution
                                that they want to go with from the range of
                                possible solutions put forward in the
                                Feasibility Report. They then need to agree
                                other details such as the budget for the project
                                and a start date for the next stage in the
                                project. If you refer back to the Systems Life
                                Cycle diagram, you will see that the next stage
                                is known as the Systems Analysis stage.
