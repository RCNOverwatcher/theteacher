                                Sometimes, too much information can be as bad as
                                too little information! A Systems Analyst will
                                quickly amass a large amount of data and
                                information, as they carry out interviews, do
                                questionnaires, collect documents and so on.

                                For example, consider a school library that is
                                completely paper-based. A Systems Analyst has
                                been asked to investigate computerising the
                                library. They would arrange an interview with
                                the librarian who would then explain how each of
                                the&nbsp;sub-systems in the library work. One
                                sub-system might be the one used to take books
                                out. The Systems Analyst would listen to what
                                the librarian says and then produce a written
                                description of it. It might go something like
                                this:
                                <br />
                                <br />

                                    A pupil selects a book from the shelf and
                                    takes it to the checkout counter. They
                                    present the book and their membership card
                                    to the librarian. The librarian retrieves
                                    the member's details from the 'members card
                                    index system'. She then checks how many
                                    books the pupil has out already. If it
                                    exceeds 3 then the pupil is told that they
                                    must return a book before they can take any
                                    other out. The librarian also checks to see
                                    if the membership has been 'blocked'. This
                                    can occur if a fine hasn't been paid for an
                                    overdue book or if the pupil has been
                                    misbehaving. If the pupil has got less than
                                    three books and the account has not been
                                    blocked, then the librarian transfers the
                                    title and author details to the memberâ€™s
                                    card and the date the book is due back. This
                                    card is then filed. The librarian retrieves
                                    the 'book details' card from the 'borrowed
                                    book card index system' and records the
                                    pupil's membership number on it and the
                                    return date. This is filed. The book is
                                    stamped with the return date and returned to
                                    the pupil with their membership card.

                                Of course, the Systems Analyst will want to go
                                back to the librarian and read back the
                                description after it has been written up, just
                                to check that they have understood everything
                                correctly and that nothing has been missed out.
                                The above example is for the 'Taking a book out'

                                to write descriptions for each sub-system:

                                and, following on from written descriptions, the

                                <br />
                                Dataflow diagrams, or DFD diagrams, are used to
                                summarise the flow of data around a system.
                                Written descriptions are fine, but pulling a lot
                                of information together in the form of a diagram
                                helps everyone involved 'see' what is going on
                                in the system a lot easier and systems can then
                                be discussed amongst different people. Because
                                systems such as the library can get quite
                                complicated, they should be broken down into
                                sub-systems, as we have already explained. Each
                                one can then be described and then a DFD can be
                                drawn for each one. There are only four basic
                                symbols in a DFD (not counting the big system
                                box in the Level zero diagram).

                                In the next example, we can see how DFDs are
                                produced. The diagram below shows the first step
                                in drawing a DFD. It shows the whole system as a
                                box. It also shows the entities such as people
                                that interact with the system as well as any
                                data that enters the system from an entity and
                                any data that leaves the system to an entity.
                                This DFD is known as a â€˜level zeroâ€™ or â€˜context
                                diagramâ€™. Notice that the librarian is not shown
                                because she is part of the system, not external
                                to it. Also notice that there are two ovals
                                representing 'pupil'. They are the same entity -
                                we could have drawn just one. This would have
                                cluttered the diagram, however, and would have
                                made it less clear. Two ovals have been drawn
                                instead. To show that they are the same entity,
                                a diagonal line is drawn in the top left of each
                                one.

                                See if you can read the description of the
                                'Taking a book out' sub-system and match it up
                                to the level one diagram. Try to follow what is
                                happening. Do note that a Systems Analyst will
                                take quite a few attempts to get the DFDs right.
                                When you do projects, don't expect to get these
                                diagrams correct at the first attempt. You need
                                to have a go at it, then discuss it with
                                someone, then sleep on it, then have another go,
                                and repeat the process until you get it right!
                                The level one diagram is a big improvement on
                                the level zero diagram because it shows the
                                processes that happen to data and what storage
                                there is. Some of the processes, such as '1.2
                                Valid' could be broken down further into what
                                are known as level two diagrams. These are
                                beyond the scope of this discussion.
                                Interestingly, this diagram can be closely
                                matched to a database. For example, where there
                                is a data store, you need to have a table in a
                                database. Where there is a process, you need to
                                have a query. Where there is a flow into the
                                system, you need to have a data input form and
                                where there is a flow out of the system, you
                                need to have a report. We are starting to move
                                closer to designing a database!

                                Diagram is known as a â€˜systems flowchartâ€™. This
                                type of diagram also gives an overall picture of
                                a system. A systems flowchart shows similar
                                information to DFDs in that it shows the
                                processes that happen on data along with the
                                data flows. In addition, however, these diagrams
                                also show what hardware is used for input, what
                                hardware is used for output and also the data
                                storage devices. They also show what type of

                                master file or a transaction file. Both system
                                flowcharts and DFDs are used by analysts to show
                                whole systems. A number of symbols are used in
                                systems flowcharts. These include (amongst
                                others):

                                An exam board marks a set of exam papers for
                                pupils at a school. They enter the marks into
                                their system, validating each mark as it is
                                entered. An error report is generated for any
                                problem marks and the marks are then re-entered.
                                Once all the marks have been entered, they are
                                sorted.&nbsp; Pupilsâ€™ information is then
                                retrieved from its system, the new marks entered
                                and the records updated. Summaries of the
                                results and certificates are then sent out. A

                                <br />
                                Structure diagrams can also be used to represent
                                systems and also program designs. They show a
                                different type of information to DFDs. One type
                                of structure diagram uses symbols from the JSD,
                                or Jackson Structured Development way of showing
                                systems. This breaks down a problem into
                                ever-increasing levels of complexity. It is read
                                from top to bottom (using a different number for
                                each level) and from left to right (using a
                                different number for each process in one level).
                                Going back to the 'Taking a book out'
                                sub-system, you could represent the sub-system
                                using the following diagram:
                              </p>

                                This type of diagram can be used to break down
                                complex problems into easier-to-understand
                                blocks. If you were programming, each block
                                could then represent a module or function. We
                                have come across this type of diagram before
                                when we discussed top-down design. Even if you
                                are not programming a system but just want to
                                understand the processes involved, this kind of
                                diagram can pull together a lot of complex
                                descriptions into a form that can be understood
                                at a glance.

                                We have introduced the idea of structure
                                diagrams above, but we have only just scratched
                                the surface. We will meet these diagrams again
                                in another chapter and take them even further.

                                <strong>Data dictionary</strong>
                                <br />
                                The data dictionary holds information about
                                data! Any system needs data to make the system
                                work. The Systems Analyst must construct a
                                dictionary of all the data items used in the
                                system because this information will be needed
                                by the people who actually build the new system,
                                who write the software. This point of reference
                                for information about data items is known as the
                                â€˜data dictionaryâ€™. They tell somebody the form
                                of the data, how each data item is actually made
                                up. Data dictionaries are often best done as a
                                table. A simple data dictionary may just have
                                the name of the data, its data type, the
                                validation rules that apply to it and an example
                                but you may also find a data dictionary with the
                                following headings being used:
                              </p>

                                        used across the project as it can lead

                                may come from existing documentation. One reason
                                why collecting documents from an existing system
                                is important is that it shows the Systems
                                Analyst what data is needed in the current
                                system, with examples of the data, where data
                                comes from, how it is used and so on.

                                details in under 0.5 seconds.

                                customer and Project Manager must agree on each
                                requirement and how it will be measured.

                                &nbsp;Each requirement must be realistically
                                achievable, taking into account the resources
                                and budget.

                                &nbsp;The project manager must be able to
                                monitor and measure the progress of the
                                achievement of a requirement. For this to
                                happen, the requirement must be something
                                tangible, something that they can see being
                                developing, something that they can tell has
                                been finished.

                                The Systems Analyst will use the written
                                description of problems as a starting point to
                                producing the RS. They will produce a 'draft
                                RSâ€™. In the draft RS, the Analyst will set out
                                what he thinks the customer should expect from
                                the new system, what the new system will be able
                                to do and how success/failure will be measured.
                                He will then arrange a meeting with the customer
                                so that they can discuss the draft. Both the
                                customer and the Analyst may well want to make a
                                few changes as a result of the meeting. The
                                Analyst then goes away and re-drafts the RS.
                                Another meeting is arranged and the re-draft is
                                discussed. If everyone is happy, both parties
                                sign and date the RS. If more work needs to be
                                done on it, then it is re-drafted again.

                                <br />
                                Once the Requirements Specification has been
                                completed, the Analyst can start outlining
                                solutions. They need to think about what
                                software will be used and how the features of
                                the software will be employed to meet the
                                requirements laid down in the Requirements
                                Specification. It is always possible in a piece
                                of software to approach a problem in different
                                ways. The Analyst should document some of these
                                possible approaches. They could also look at
                                different applications to solve the problem and
                                compare and contrast the ability of each
                                application to meet the needs of the
                                Requirements Specification. They may also look
                                at designing a completely new application from
                                scratch. Whichever of the solutions is
                                preferred, it should be justified. There should
                                be a clear statement which identifies the
                                features of the software that will solve the
                                problem as laid out in the Specification.

                                The Analyst needs to produce a list of the
                                hardware and software that is being used in the
                                current system (if applicable). When a list has
                                been drawn up of what exists currently, they
                                should then comment on how this may or may not
                                impact on any future solution. They might be
                                able at this stage to identify that certain
                                software is being considered for a solution, but
                                the software cannot be run on the existing
                                machines because they are not of the right
                                specification, for example. It may be that there
                                are only standalone computers at a business but
                                the analyst is thinking of using email and
                                shared resources that require a network. The
                                Analyst should then draw up a list of any new
                                software and hardware that will be needed. They
                                should also justify these proposed purchases to
                                the company so that they are clear about the
                                reasons for spending their money on this
                                equipment. Once the Requirements Specification
                                is completed and agreed to, the real work can
                                begin! The Systems Analyst can start designing
                                the detail of the new computerised system in the
                                next stage of the Systems Life Cycle - the
                                Design stage.
