                                You are likely to come across descriptions of
                                the Systems Life Cycle in various books and
                                online that include references to an
                                "implementation stage", which the writers then
                                manage to confuse with an "installation stage".
                                Implementation is concerned with taking the
                                design produced in the design stage and turning
                                it into a real, actual working system. It means
                                building the system from the design documents
                                This is not the same as "installation".
                                Installation is taking the finished, built and
                                tested product from the design company’s
                                premises and putting it into the customer’s
                                premises, ready to be used.&nbsp;

                                Thorough testing should be carried out once the
                                system has been built. It should follow the test
                                plan produced in the Design stage. All results
                                should be documented and cross-referenced just
                                in case there is a problem in the future, to
                                prove that they have been carried out properly
                                and thoroughly. Ensuring that a system works is
                                very important.

                                      into the news for the wrong reasons! In
                                      some cases, it could cause the company to
                                      go bust.

                                      frustrating to use and will stop using it.
                                      Their company can only suffer because they
                                      have invested a lot of money in a system

                                      Once a product has been built and tested
                                      in the system designer's buildings, it
                                      then needs to be installed in the

                                      minimum disruption to the business.
                                      Excellent planning is essential to install
                                      a new product with the minimum of
                                      disruption.

                                      Staff training on the new system must take
                                      place. This should include those who will
                                      use the system and those who will support
                                      others in the initial phases of
                                      installation, for example the Network
                                      Administrator or the various managers.
                                      This has implications for the business. If
                                      staff are training, they are not working!
                                      The cost of this should be taken into
                                      account when the project is planned.

                                      When a new system is to replace an old
                                      system, the data files kept on the old
                                      system needs to be transferred. Someone
                                      has to actually do this and this takes
                                      money, time and resources. In addition,
                                      any data transferred to the new system
                                      should be current. It would be of little
                                      use to transfer data from the old system
                                      to the new system one day but then not use
                                      the new system for a week. There would be
                                      one week's worth of data out-of-date!

                                The hardware and software must be in place. Any

                                <strong>Parallel running</strong>
                                <br />
                                The new system is run alongside the old system.
                                Both systems operate together. This allows the
                                new system to prove itself before the old system
                                is abandoned - data generated by the new system
                                can be compared to data generated by the old
                                system. It also means that staff can be trained
                                and gain confidence in the new system. Of
                                course, if you are running two systems together,
                                that means twice as much work for everyone for a
                                short time!

                                <strong>Pilot running</strong>
                                <br />
                                According to the BCS, pilot running is when the
                                new system is run alongside the old system, but
                                only a portion of the data is actually used in
                                the new system. This method is less of a drain
                                on resources. Data from part of the new system
                                can be compared with the old system, but you
                                cannot check how the whole system will react
                                until you have got the whole system up and
                                running. The term pilot running can also be
                                applied when a system is to be installed in a
                                chain of stores e.g. when a new store accounts
                                system is to be installed in each of twenty
                                stores in a chain. The whole system will be put
                                intro one store and piloted. When it has proven
                                itself, it will be rolled out to other stores,
                                one at a time.

                                <br />
                                The old system is stopped and the new system is
                                started. This might happen over a weekend, for
                                example. If something goes wrong with the new
                                system, then it has to be sorted out because you
                                cannot fall back on the old system. Staff
                                training needs to take place in advance with
                                this method.

                                <strong>Phased implementation</strong>
                                <br />
                                Parts of a new system completely replace parts
                                of an old system, whilst the old system
                                continues to be used as required. The part of
                                the new system that has been installed can be
                                used for staff training and can prove itself
                                before the next part of the installation takes
                                place. This method takes longer than the direct
                                changeover method. A company with 10 branches
                                may install a new accounting system in one
                                branch first, for example. They run it in the
                                branch until it has proven itself and possibly
                                bring in staff members from other branches for
                                training. Once the system has proven itself in
                                one branch, it can then be phased into the other
                                branches.
