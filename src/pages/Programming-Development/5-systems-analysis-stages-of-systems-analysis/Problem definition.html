                                  A system that is currently in place in an
                                  organisation is not doing its job efficiently.
                                  Perhaps the business has grown and the system
                                  can't cope anymore. Perhaps too many problems
                                  keep arising.
                                </li>

                                  Perhaps it is a new business that needs a way
                                  of solving a problem, e.g. it needs to take
                                  on-line payments.

                                  Perhaps an old system isn't flexible enough,
                                  or costs too much to run.
                                </li>

                                  Perhaps there is a change in legislation that
                                  requires an existing computer system to be
                                  modified in some way.
                                </li>

                                  Perhaps the company has heard of some new
                                  technology that they think may help them make
                                  their business more efficient and give them an
                                  advantage over their competitors.

                            Whatever the reason, a manager will notice that a
                            system needs to be looked at. In the first instance,
                            they will arrange a meeting with a Systems Analyst.

                            <strong>The first meeting</strong><br />A Systems
                            Analyst's job is to take charge of assessing a
                            problem and to see whether or not it is suitable for
                            computerisation, or whether an existing computer
                            system can be upgraded. They will be expert in
                            assessing situations. They will have a wide
                            knowledge of existing computer technology and will
                            be able to visualise what can be achieved with this
                            technology.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Before a Systems Analyst&nbsp;solves a problem,
                            however, they need to be clear what the problem is!
                            This might sound like common sense but can take a
                            lot of time to get clear and it must be clear before
                            any real work begins. When company X has a problem,
                            they will call in a Systems Analyst to look into it.
                            We can assume that the company will be expert in
                            whatever area of business they are in. They will not
                            be expert in computer systems. They will not know
                            about the latest technology. They will not
                            necessarily know all that can be achieved using
                            computers in their business area. This is where the
                            potential problem lies. The Systems Analyst is an
                            expert in computer systems, but not company X's
                            business. Company X is an expert in their business
                            but may at best, have only a vague idea about
                            computer technology and what it can do for the
                            business. Yet they have to talk together at the
                            beginning of a project to decide what the project
                            aims are. It is a little like two people who speak
                            two different languages meeting together. They have
                            to find a common way to communicate.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            When company X calls in the Systems Analyst for the
                            first time, they will sit down together and company
                            X will explain why they have contacted the Systems
                            Analyst. The Systems Analyst will listen carefully
                            and will also use this opportunity to ask any
                            questions, perhaps clarifying some of the jargon
                            that company X has used during the discussion or
                            double-checking that they have understood what they
                            have been told by the company. Together, they will
                            try to define the 'scope' of the problem. They will
                            try to flesh out what the problem is in language
                            that both company X and the Systems Analyst
                            understand.
