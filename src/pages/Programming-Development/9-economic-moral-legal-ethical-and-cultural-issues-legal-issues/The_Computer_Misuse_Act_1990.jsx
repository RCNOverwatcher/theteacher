                                </strong>
                                This law came in to being specifically to deal
                                with hackers, people who seek to gain
                                unauthorised access to computer systems. In the
                                early days of computing, hackers were seen as 'a
                                little bit naughty'. It soon became apparent
                                that they could cause untold damage to national
                                security, cause havoc with a company's
                                legitimate operations and could steal a lot of
                                money! Existing legislation was difficult to
                                apply to hackers. The Government's response was
                                the Computer Misuse Act 1990.

                                      It makes it illegal to access data to
                                      which you have no right. For example, you
                                      are not allowed to try to guess or find
                                      out a friend's password and then gain
                                      access to their files! You can be fined
                                      and jailed for up to 6 months.

                                      It makes a more serious offence of
                                      accessing data to which you have no right
                                      with the intention of carrying out other
                                      crimes. For example, if you hacked into a
                                      bank's system with the intention of
                                      stealing credit card numbers, then you
                                      would fall foul of this law. You can be
                                      fined and jailed for up to 5 years.
                                    </li>

                                      It makes it illegal to change any data. If
                                      you hack into an area to which you have no
                                      right and start deleting files or
                                      modifying data then you will be breaking
                                      this law. You can be fined and jailed for
                                      up to 5 years.
