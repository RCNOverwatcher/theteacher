                                The Internet and phone communications have
                                provided opportunities for those people who want
                                to harass others in some way. This can include
                                sending malicious emails or texts, following
                                them around on the Internet via their social
                                websites and posting hurtful messages (called
                                'cyber-stalking'), posting hurtful messages to
                                people they know, pretending to be someone they
                                are not and posting hurtful messages and posting
                                intimate pictures of someone, perhaps from when
                                they were in a relationship. Sending messages as
                                in the above examples is against the law and can
                                lead to a criminal record.

                                Section 1 of the Malicious Communications Act
                                1998 says it is an offence to send an indecent,
                                offensive or threatening letter, electronic
                                communication or other article to another
                                person. Section 85 of the&nbsp;Communications
                                Act 2003 and Section 85 of the Postal Services
                                Act 2000 detail similar specific offences
                                related to sending postal or telephone messages
                                which are indecent, offensive or threatening.
                                Both offences are punishable with up to six
                                months imprisonment and/or a fine. Because the
                                Malicious Communications Offence covers more
                                areas than the Telecommunications offence it is
                                more likely to be used by the Police than the
                                Postal Services or Communications Act offences.

                                In most cases involving malicious
                                communications, there will be multiple offensive
                                or threatening letters or telephone calls and
                                therefore the police will usually charge the
                                offender with an offence under Section 2 of the
                                Protection from Harassment Act 1997. One reason
                                is that when someone is convicted of an offence
                                under the Protection from Harassment Act, the
                                court can make a Restraining Order to stop them
                                from contacting their victim again. Breach of a
                                Restraining Order is punishable with up to Five
                                years imprisonment. A Restraining Order can't be
                                made for a conviction under the Postal Services
                                or Communications Act offences.

                                If the messages e-mails or phone calls suggest
                                violence might be used against the victim, the
                                police can charge the accused under Section 4 of
                                the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. This
                                can lead to Five years imprisonment and a
                                Restraining Order can be imposed.&nbsp;
