                                The first thing that needs to be done when
                                solving a problem using a programming language
                                is to describe how to solve it! This will then
                                lead the programmer into producing efficient
                                code that will perform the task. There are a
                                number of ways to describe a problem that we
                                wish to write a program for. However we decide
                                to describe a problem, it is known as an ‘
                                <strong>algorithm</strong>’. An algorithm is
                                simply a list of instructions that describe how
                                to do a particular task. All that needs to
                                happen is that the programmer analyses a task
                                and writes down (or draws) step-by-step how the
                                solution is to solve the problem. A programmer
                                may also decide to write algorithms to describe
                                the problem in the first place, and then write
                                algorithms to describe the solution. Whichever
                                approach is taken, there is some good news when
                                writing algorithms. There are no rules dictating
                                what you have to do and how you have to do it!

                                      You can produce an algorithm by writing a
                                      list of sentences.

                                      You can produce an algorithm by drawing a
                                      diagram, for example, a flow chart. This
                                      is explained in section 3.2.1.

                                      You can produce an algorithm by writing
                                      instructions using pseudo-code. This is

                                As has already been said, there are no rules to
                                follow when writing algorithms. As long as your
                                argument is structured and logical you can write
                                or draw what you like. However, a popular way of
                                representing algorithms is to use
                                <strong>pseudo-code</strong>.

                                When writing algorithms, there are two broad
                                questions to ask:

                                      What 'special cases' need to be taken into
                                      account in the code?
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                      What happens if the wrong data type is
                                      entered?

                                Dealing with special cases is initially down to
                                experience. The more practice you have of
                                writing algorithms and programs, the easier it
                                is to decide what special cases need to be dealt
                                with.
