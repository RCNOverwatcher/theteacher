                            Logic gate diagrams and truth tables

                          <p>
                            <strong>Introduction</strong><br />We have seen how
                            logic gates work and how to represent them on paper.
                            Now we can start to putting the logic gates
                            together, to build complex logic diagrams. We can
                            also see how truth tables are an invaluable tool
                            when trying to understand what a logic diagram does.
                            When presented with any logic diagram, you should
                            always construct a truth table, that spells out
                            exactly what the output is after every gate. That
                            way, you will be able to work out what the final
                            output will be for all the different permutations of
                            inputs.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            <strong>Example 1</strong><br />Consider this logic
                            diagram:
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <img
                              style="
                                display: block;
                                margin-left: auto;
                                margin-right: auto;
                              "
                              src="images/30c8ac91-fa5a-4fd0-9c50-d8f983dfee8fANDNOT.GIF"
                              alt="ANDNOT"
                            />
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            What is the output? The output from the AND gate is
                            true when both A and B are true. Otherwise, the
                            output is false. This then feeds into the NOT gate.
                            If the input into the NOT gate is false, the output
                            C is true. If the input to the NOT gate is true, the
                            output C is false.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Now this is starting to get complicated and we only
                            have two logic gates! Imaging if we had hundreds
                            connected together. This is where truth tables
                            become invaluable. Rather than trying to work out
                            what is going on in a logic diagram in one go, and
                            trying to keep track of what is happening in our
                            heads, we can use truth tables to help, working out
                            the logic at each stage in the diagram.

                          <p>
                            First of all, we work out the output for the AND
                            gate from the combinations of inputs. We create a
                            column for the results. We feed these results into
                            our NOT gate, producing yet another column for these
                            results. We now have a complete truth table, which
                            we can use to predict the output for any combination
                            of inputs.

                            <strong>Example 2</strong><br />Consider this logic

                            What is the final output, C? We could try to work it
                            out in our heads, although it is easy to get quickly
                            confused. It would be better to produce a truth
                            table of the diagram. That way, we can consider each
                            part of the diagram in steps.

                            We can look at Input A and then do NOT A. We can
                            then look at Input B and do NOT B. We can then use
                            the columns for NOT A and NOT B to do the AND gate.
                            This is the final output for this logic diagram.

                            different permutations without using a truth table
                            will be difficult. When you do use a truth table,
                            however, it all becomes much easier. Notice this
                            time, however, that both Input A and Input B are fed
                            into two different logic gates at the start of the
                            diagram on the left. It doesn't make any difference
                            to producing the truth table. We just do the logic
                            for each gate in turn as before.

                            combination of inputs was fed in. The difference
                            here is what logic gates were used to create the
                            logic diagram. It is entirely possible to create the
                            same outputs for the given inputs by using different

                            The procedure is exactly the same. Firstly, we will
                            work out the number of possible combinations of
                            inputs of A, B and C, which we have already said is
                            eight. Then we will work out the logic after each
                            gate, and build up our truth table until we get to
                            the final output. Our final truth table will look
                            like this:
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <img
                              style="
                                margin: 10px auto;
                                vertical-align: middle;
                                display: block;
                              "
                              src="images/82901fef-5e16-44e8-9bd3-7b9bc5a032d43inputstruth.GIF"
                              alt="3inputstruth"
                            />
                          </p>
                          <p></p>
                        </div>
                      </div>

                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
