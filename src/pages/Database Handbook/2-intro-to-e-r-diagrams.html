                              Introduction to E-R diagrams
                            </h1>
                            <p>
                              <strong>Introduction</strong><br />There are two
                              approaches that database designers commonly use to
                              come up with a design for a relational database.
                              They are used together, even though at first you
                              may think they are completely different approaches
                              that produce different designs for the same
                              system!!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              E-R diagrams. The first approach is to produce an
                              E-R diagram of the proposed system. The designer
                              will ask themselves what obvious ‘entities’ exist
                              in a system and how are they related. Entities are
                              identifiable objects in a database about which you
                              would store information. We have already seen lots
                              of examples of entities such as Member, Dog,
                              Breed, Undergraduate and Degree. Each of these
                              entities requires a table to store real-life
                              examples of that entity in (known as ‘records’).
                              Each actual record is stored in a row in the
                              appropriate table. Each record is made up of
                              ‘fields’. A field is a piece of information you
                              keep about an entity. In the Member’s table in the
                              previous section, fields included, Initial,
                              Surname, Title, Sex and Postcode, for example.
                              Database designers often also refer to the
                              ‘attributes’ of a particular record rather than
                              ‘fields’ but they mean the same thing. Notice that
                              fields are the columns in tables. Once the
                              designer has come up with an E-R diagram of
                              logically linked entities, they can then go ahead
                              and build the database.

                            <p>
                              Normalisation. A second technique the database
                              designer can use is known as ‘normalisation’. This
                              has its roots in mathematical analysis and can
                              produce a very efficient design. It involves
                              identifying all of the possible attributes in a
                              database and then applying a set of rules to them
                              in turn. Each stage in the process of
                              normalisation can result in a ‘better’ design.
                            </p>

                              ><br />Normalisation will produce database designs
                              that can be shown mathematically to be the ‘best’
                              design. By this, we mean a design that minimises
                              the amount of data redundancy. However, it may not
                              necessarily produce the best design in terms of
                              ease of understanding for humans! In practice, the
                              designer will use both techniques together!

                                    The designer may well start a new design by
                                    producing an E-R diagram of the proposed
                                    system.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>
                                    They might then produce a Data Dictionary
                                    that details what attributes make up each
                                    entity.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>
                                    Finally, they might take each table in turn
                                    and ‘normalise’ it, to check that there are
                                    no data redundancy problems and that
                                    problems associated with adding and deleting
                                    records and amending data are removed.
                                    Normalisation in this case is used to
                                    validate the E-R diagram the designer has
                                    come up with.

                            </ul>

                                    The designer may well start a new design by
                                    producing an E-R diagram of the proposed
                                    system.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>
                                    They might then produce a Data Dictionary
                                    that details what attributes make up each
                                    entity.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>
                                    They might then list all the attributes they
                                    have identified in the Data Dictionary and
                                    normalise them together. This will produce a
                                    set of related tables.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>
                                    They then compare the design of the database
                                    using the E-R diagram they produced with the
                                    design produced by normalising the
                                    attributes.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>
                                    They will decide which design they want to
                                    go with (if they are different). It may
                                    mean, for example, that they decide to go
                                    with the E-R diagram because it is an easier
                                    design to follow, or they may go for the
                                    normalised design because it is the best for
                                    eliminating data redundancy, or they may use
                                    a hybrid of both designs, based on the
                                    designer’s prior experience. Whichever
                                    design is chosen, however, it is up to the
                                    database designer to fully justify it!!

                              We will start looking at how relational databases
                              are designed by first looking at E-R modelling. We
                              will then look in considerable detail at
                              normalisation.

                              ><br />An E-R diagram is a diagram that database
                              designers use to show the relationships between
                              groups of data (each group being known as an
                              ‘entity’). It gives the designer a very simple yet
                              effective overview of the entities in a system and
                              how they relate to each other.

                                    It is a useful way of summarising what
                                    entities and therefore what tables are
                                    needed in a relational database.

                                    It is a concise way of representing the
                                    relationships between records in tables.
                                    This can then be used both as a reference
                                    for the designer when setting up foreign
                                    keys and as a means of identifying
                                    ‘many-to-many relationships’, which can then
                                    be ‘resolved’. (See later in this section
                                    for further details about many-to-many
                                    relationships and why you need to resolve
                                    them).

                                    It can be used as a check to normalisation
                                    and a discussion aid. The results of both
                                    methods could be used together in design
                                    meetings. The design team can then discuss
                                    these designs and argue out how to go
                                    forward.

                                    of the design of the database and needs to
                                    be part of the technical manual. In the
                                    future, some maintenance of the database may
                                    be necessary. The person doing it (who may
                                    not be the original designer) needs to know
