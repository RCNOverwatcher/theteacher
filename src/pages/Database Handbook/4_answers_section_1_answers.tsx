                                <strong>TASK 1.</strong> A flat file is a file
                                where all the data in the database is stored in
                                only one table. The rows in the table correspond
                                to records whilst the columns correspond to
                                fields.
                              </p>

                                <strong>TASK 2.</strong> They should consider
                                not only what training staff need but also what
                                their retraining needs will be. They need to
                                consider what new staff with new skills they
                                should employ. They have to check they have
                                sufficient wiring, power points and network
                                points in place for any new hardware. They need
                                to consider what they will do if the computer
                                system breaks down and who will provide routine
                                maintenance, fault-finding and advice. They need
                                to consider how they will back up valuable data
                                and their back-up policy. They need to take into
                                account the provisions of the Data Protection
                                Act 1998. They should check any Health and
                                Safety issues to do with such things as correct
                                benching and adjustable chairs, lighting,
                                ventilation, emissions from screens as well as
                                training the staff in Health and Safety issues.
                                They need to consider what future needs they may
                                have and strike a balance between
                                future-proofing equipment and software and
                                buying things they don’t need now.

                                <strong>TASK 3.</strong> Flat files are fine
                                when there are only a small number of records to
                                be stored.
                              </p>

                                <strong>TASK 4.</strong> Data redundancy refers
                                to data in a database that is stored over and
                                over again.
                              </p>

                                <strong>TASK 5.</strong> An amendment anomaly is
                                the term used to describe what can go wrong when
                                you have to change the same pieces of data in
                                different places in a file. There is a danger
                                that the user will make a spelling mistake, for
                                example, with one of the pieces of data. If this
                                happens, that piece of data becomes different to
                                the other pieces of data - it has been changed
                                into something that it is not accidentally. We
                                say that the data has become inconsistent when
                                this happens.

                                <strong>TASK 6.</strong> Each degree is studied
                                by many undergraduates. Each undergraduate
                                studies one degree.

                                <strong>TASK 7.</strong> A primary key is an
                                attribute in a record whose value for each
                                record is unique - you cannot have two primary
                                key values that are the same. They uniquely
                                identify a particular record.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                <strong>TASK 8.</strong> Relational databases
                                help get rid of redundant data. They also help
                                by getting rid of adding, deleting and amendment
                                anomalies.
                              </p>

                                <strong>TASK 9.</strong> Some data is stored
                                over and over again, such as Mr Smith’s record.
                                Some data is inconsistent, such as Sam’s Hits
                                and Sam’s Hits album. They have different names
                                but are the same product (same ID). Mr Smith’s
                                phone number is also slightly different in two
                                different records. Peter Song’s name has been
                                stored in a different record as Pete Song. These
                                are more examples of inconsistent data as well
                                as data that is needlessly duplicated.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                <strong>TASK 10.</strong> Some data has been
                                unnecessarily duplicated e.g. Mr Green’s
                                details. Mr Green’s phone number is different in
                                different records. Elephant Street has also been
                                recorded as Elephant St - this is inconsistent.
                                Book 34 has been recorded as Africa as well as
                                African History and Staff member 33 has been
                                recorded as S Jones and Sam Jones. These are
                                also examples of data inconsistencies.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                <strong>TASK 11.</strong> The manager may search
                                for a particular staff member by ID number, but
                                may get back two names that are not consistent
                                (Daisy Arm and Miss Arm, for example). The
                                manager may search for a particular product by
                                the product’s ID, but might be confused by the
                                different descriptions returned for the same
                                product. For example, ‘Blue toilet roll holder’
                                and ‘Roll holder’. It will be a problem to
                                search between two dates because the date
                                information is not stored in a consistent
                                format.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
