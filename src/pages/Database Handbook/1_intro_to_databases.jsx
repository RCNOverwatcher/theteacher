                                  <br />
                                  According to the British Computer Society's
                                  glossary, a database "is a (large) collection
                                  of data items and links between them.
                                  structured in a way that allows it to be
                                  accessed by a number of different applications
                                  programs".
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  At a very simple level, a database can be a
                                  collection of names and their associated phone
                                  numbers, like you might have on your mobile
                                  phone, or it could be the details of members
                                  in a local club kept in a book. It could be a
                                  larger set of details, like you might find in
                                  the Yellow Pages. It could be a collection of
                                  records about patients that are kept in a
                                  doctor's surgery, or a set of tax records for
                                  all of the companies in the UK, or the records
                                  about criminals and crimes that the police
                                  keep, or details about the stock kept in a
                                  supermarket and so on. In fact, when you start
                                  looking, databases are absolutely everywhere
                                  and used by many different kinds of people
                                  regularly.

                                  Databases originally were all paper-based.
                                  Each piece of information about each person,
                                  or a club member, or a company, or a product,
                                  for example,&nbsp;was known as an 'attribute'.
                                  All of the attributes together (all of the
                                  details about a person, a company etc) were
                                  known as a 'record' and were collected
                                  together and typically written on one card.
                                  The record cards were then collected together
                                  to form a 'file'. This file was then put into
                                  a filing cabinet. Users would then go into it
                                  to find information in the records. A
                                  'database' was simply one or more files, so
                                  for example, you might have a file for
                                  animals' details, another for vets' details,
                                  another for all of the zoos in the country and
                                  so on. All the files together (although there
                                  might only be just one) were known as a
                                  database.
