                            <strong>Improving the flat file design</strong
                            ><br />Clearly, there are problems with flat file
                            databases. However, there is something that can be
                            done about it!&nbsp;Having two smaller tables is no
                            different to having one big table, as long as we
                            link them (or ‘relate’ them - hence the term
                            ‘relational database’). Consider one record in a
                            table. We can have one big record in one table, or
                            split the big record into two parts and link them
                            together (using a special link called a 'foreign
                            key'). One obvious way to split the table is to have
                            a table for members and a table for dogs. We can
                            draw a diagram of this (called an E-R diagram, or
                            Entity-Relationship diagram). ‘Entity’ is just a
                            fancy name for a table, so this diagram shows the
                            relationship between entities, or tables.<strong

                              >It is a very good idea to put some real or
                              made-up records into the tables you have
                              identified as part of your E-R analysis. It really
                              helps you to ‘visualise’ the problem. Note that
                              when you split up a table into two or more smaller
                              tables, the first thing you have to do is to check
                              that each of the tables you have got has a primary
                              key, a field whose value for every single record
                              (i.e. every single row) will be unique - no other
                              record will have the same value. The members’
                              table has such a field (ID) but the dogs’ table
                              doesn’t have a suitable one. One simple solution
                              (but not the only one) is to add an ID attribute
                              to the dogs’ table and make this the primary key.
                              We will call this new added field ‘DogID’.</span

                          <p>
                            The second thing we need to do is to check that each
                            record in one table is related to a record in the
                            other table. We can do this by using a ‘foreign
                            key’; we copy the primary key from the one side
                            (members) and put it in the many side (dogs). In
                            other words, we copy the relevant ID from the
                            member’s table and put in the relevant record for
                            each dog. We now can view our improved database
                            design:

                            How is the relational database an improvement over
                            the flat file design?
