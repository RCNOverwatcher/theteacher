                            >It is important for a computer to use all of the
                            fixed-size resources wisely. You want the CPU to
                            work as hard as possible and you want to make the
                            best use of your cache and main memory, for example.
                            We will now look in more detail at how the main
                            memory is managed to get the most from it.

                            Main memory typically is split into two partitions.
                            One, called Low Memory, is where the operating
                            system is placed. The other, called High Memory, is
                            where the processes that need to be run are put.
                            Processes are simply the jobs that have to be
                            carried out by the Central Processing Unit. These
                            will include running applications but also jobs that
                            have to be done in the background, such as managing
                            the input and output to a printer or speakers, for
                            example. All the processes that need to be run are
                            put in a queue.

                              >Partitions and fragmentation<br /></strong
                            >Operating systems can manage the main memory in a
                            number of ways, including using partitions, paging
                            and segmentation. With partitions, the main memory
                            is divided up into areas, which can be a fixed size
                            or a variable size. Each process in the queue is
                            allocated to one partition, assuming that the
                            process can fit in the partition. If it can't, then
                            parts of the process have to be switched in and out
                            of the partition as and when necessary. When a
                            partition is free, another process from the queue is
                            passed to the partition, until the process is
                            finished and the partition is freed up again.&nbsp;
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            A process will use up an entire partition, whether
                            it needs the entire partition or not. This is one
                            inefficent problem with this method, although having
                            a number of different sized partitions for the
                            operating system to select from can decrease this
                            problem because you can then assign a process to the
                            smallest partition that it will fit in. As processes
                            are loaded and removed from partitions, the memory
                            can become fragmented and some areas of memory will
                            be unused. This is an inefficient use of
                            resources.&nbsp;

                            ><br />
                            Another method of managing the memory is to use
                            paging. Each application will have associated with
                            it a page table. This will identify each page for
                            each application and will contain information about
                            where to find that page if it is on the hard disk in
                            virtual memory. If a page is in RAM then the entry
                            for that particular page will be blank. When a page
                            is needed, the operating system looks up the page
                            reference in the page table, finds out where it is
                            in virtual memory and then transfers it from the
                            hard disk to the primary memory.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            This, of course, all takes time and contributes to
                            the computer slowing down. This kind of tracking
                            system for pages is relatively simple to implement
                            but there are some disadvantages.
                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type: none">
                              <ul style="list-style-type: disc">

                                  Paging is a simple system to implement but may
                                  not be the most efficient. This is because the
                                  pages are of a fixed size. A page may only
                                  have a small amount of data in it but will
                                  require a whole page to store it in.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Pages are fixed sizes. They will contain code
                                  that may not be a logical group of code (for
                                  example, a logical block of code such as a
                                  function might run across 6 different pages).
                                  This means that to load that particular
                                  function will require 6 pages to be loaded up,
                                  which is not as efficient as loading e.g. one
                                  page for the whole function.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Page tables are typically large and accessing
                                  them slows down the computer.
                                </li>
                              </ul>

                            An alternative approach is to use segmentation.
                            Instead of pages being a fixed size, they are a
                            variable size. Because their size can vary, code can
                            be logically grouped into one segment. You could
                            have a segment per procedure, for example, and this
                            would reduce the size of the tables needed to store
                            the segment information. The downside to
                            segmentation is that retrieving a segment is more
                            complicated. You need to store both the start
                            address of a segment and the size of the segment.
                            Start addresses have to be calculated with care
                            because the sizes of each segment varies. With
                            paging, it is entirely predictable where each page
                            starts and finishes.
