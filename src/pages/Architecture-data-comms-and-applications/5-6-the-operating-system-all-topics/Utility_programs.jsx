                                Operating systems come with a range of what is
                                know as 'utility programs' for the user or
                                computer to use. A utility program is simply a
                                program that is part of the operating system
                                which performs a commonplace task. We will have
                                a look at some common ones in this section.

                                Anti-virus software is used to help protect your
                                computer against viruses. A virus is a program
                                written by someone and distributed across the
                                Internet, by email or by sharing storage
                                devices. They are sometimes designed to do
                                nothing more than annoy (like making your keys
                                beep each time you press one on your keyboard)
                                but they often do a lot of damage such as wiping
                                your hard drive clean or allowing your computer
                                to be accessed by a hacker remotely. As
                                thousands of new viruses are written every week,
                                it is important to ensure that virus patterns
                                are kept up-to-date. This can usually be done
                                automatically. There are free versions of
                                anti-virus software and there are also many
                                paid-for versions as well. These often come with
                                many additional features and support if there is
                                a problem. Sometimes, anti-virus programs are
                                classed as an 'application' because some do many
                                different things. Other times, they are very
                                focussed on destroying viruses so are classed as
                                a utility program.&nbsp;

                                Spyware is software that installs itself on your
                                computer and then gathers information about
                                passwords, what Internet sites you visit and
                                other confidential information with the aim of
                                transmitting it to criminals to use. You can
                                download spyware programs unwittingly when you
                                download open source or free applications from
                                the Internet so it is always a good idea to only
                                download software from trusted web sites. There
                                have even been instances of criminals setting up
                                sites that look like they are offering free
                                anti-spyware programs so you need to be careful.
                                Anti-spyware applications are available from the
                                Internet. One that has been around for a long
                                time is Ad-Aware.

                                and to stop worms and other malware from

                                <strong>Formatting utility</strong>
                                <br />
                                Operating systems come with a utility that
                                allows you to format devices when you connect
                                them to your computer. Before you first use a
                                storage device such as a hard drive, an SD card,
                                a DVD or a pen drive, they have to be set-up for
                                use. This is called 'formatting'. You will be
                                storing lots of files on the device and they
                                have to be organised so that the operating
                                system can find them again. When you 'format' a
                                disk, you are creating a table that will be
                                stored on the storage device itself. As you add
                                and delete files, the operating system updates
                                this table and therefore keeps track of where
                                everything is.&nbsp;Sometimes, these media come
                                pre-formatted and sometimes, you have to do it
                                yourself using the format utility program.

                                Operating systems have a commonly used program
                                to copy files across from one device to another.
                                When you plug in a pen drive into a computer,
                                the operating system detects that you have done
                                this. Then, if you want to save a file to it,
                                this utility program opens and takes over the
                                moving of the file.

                                <br />
                                When you save a file or program on your hard
                                disk or other storage device, it is tempting to
                                think that it is all saved together.
                                Unfortunately, that is not usually the case.
                                When you save a file, the operating system looks
                                at what space it has free on the hard drive and
                                then breaks up the file into chunks. It then
                                stores these chunks all over the hard disk, in
                                whatever spaces are available. As long as the
                                operating keeps track of where these chunks are,
                                it isn't usually a problem because of the speed
                                the CPU works at. Over time, however, if too
                                many files are spread over a disk, it will start
                                to take a long time to read those files back.
                                The hard drive is a mechanical device that has
                                moving parts. These moving parts have to move to
                                collect each chunk of a file when you want to
                                open it so that it can rebuild the file.The
                                operating system has a defragmentation utility
                                program that will reorganise these chunks so
                                that they are next to each other or as close to
                                each other as possible on the storage device.
                                This will make it faster to get back files and
                                also free up bigger spaces for files you save in
                                the future.

                                you use will be downloaded and stored locally on
                                your computer and you will also generate
                                temporary files just by using your operating
                                system. You can properly delete them all by
                                using your operating system's clean-up tools.
                                When you delete files, they are usually moved
                                into a Recycle bin of some sort. This can then
                                be periodically emptied as well.

                                As problems are discovered with your operating
                                system and with software and solutions found,
                                and as newer versions of software become
                                available, you should download and install them.
                                In some cases it won't matter when you do it but
                                in other cases, which involve security issues
                                with your computer, it is important to download
                                them as soon as they become available. You can
                                set up your operating system to notify you when
                                updates become available and to download and
                                install them as well. This will ensure that
                                necessary jobs are done in a timely fashion and
                                not constantly put off.

                                <strong>File compression</strong>
                                <br />
                                File compression means that you take a file,
                                some files or a folder and you give it to some
                                compression software that 'squashes it'. This
                                makes it much smaller than the original size.
                                This is sometimes known as zipping up a file or
                                folder. What file compression software actually
                                does is to look at each file you want to
                                compress and see if it can construct rules to
                                reduce the size of the file. There are a number
                                of reasons why you might want to compress
                                documents. Compressed files and folders take
                                less time to transmit across the Internet than
                                the original files, because they are smaller. If
                                you had, for example, video files or music files
                                to send, which can be very large, this might be
                                important.&nbsp;If you were the BBC and wanted
                                to 'stream' video (where people watch the video
                                at the same time the BBC is sending it) then you
                                need your large files to be as small as possible
                                or the video will slow or stop from time to
                                time.&nbsp;You can store more files, programs
                                and data on any storage device such as your pen
                                drive if they are compressed.&nbsp;If you want
                                to send ten files by email, an efficient way to
                                send them is to first put them in a zip folder.
                                The zip folder can be attached to an email in
                                the same way that a file can be attached to an
                                email. (Note, however, that you can't attach a
                                normal folder to an email usually.)

                                There are lots of free data compression programs
                                available and some that you have to pay for.
                                Windows comes with a free utility program in the
                                File Manager, just right-click and then select
                                'New' folder by 'Compressed Folder'. 7-Zip is
                                open source and very good, as is the Hamster
                                Free Zip application. You can also download and
                                try out an evaluation copy of WinZip, another
                                well-known compression utility.

                                <strong>Backing up data</strong>
                                <br />
                                Have you ever lost work you have done on the
                                computer? Do you backup your work onto a pen
                                drive every time you do some work on the
                                computer? If you don't, you should! Given the
                                amount of coursework you probably have to do, it
                                is a wise approach keeping up-to-date backup
                                copies of work that goes towards your final
                                course grades! Your teacher would have told you
                                to do this many times and you will get little
                                sympathy from anyone if you lose work! Companies
                                must also back up their work. If you lose your
                                work, you can start again - not much fun but
                                possible. If a company loses files they could go
                                out of business. People could lose livelihoods.
                                Data is valuable to an organisation. It takes
                                companies years to build up a customer base.
                                Getting data into a computer takes time.
                                Businesses today are run on computers.

                                Operating systems usually come with utility
                                programs to allow you to take back-ups. Typical
                                options include the ability to take an entire
                                'snapshot' of your hard drive (called a 'system
                                image') so that if your hard drive fails, you
                                simply replace it, and then run a recovery
                                program on a pen drive or CD that loads the
                                system image onto your new hard drive. Another
                                option is to schedule back-ups so that back-ups
                                happen automatically at a particular time of
                                day. You can also tell your computer to do a
                                full back-up (all of your data files), only
                                back-up files that have been added or altered
                                since the last time you did a back-up (called an
                                'incremental back-up') or only back-up files
                                from certain folders. Most people used to
                                back-up to an external hard drive but it is
                                becoming more common to back-up to cloud storage
                                now.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                The last point about back-ups to make is that an
                                untested back-up should not be depended upon.
                                You should periodically test files being backed
                                up to see if the process has been working
                                correctly. Unfortunately, some people do not do
                                this and find out that their system has not been
                                backing things up correctly only when their hard
                                drive fails! This can be a disaster, of course.
