                                <br />A virus is a program that has been written
                                by someone. It can replicate itself, be attached
                                to files and applications and can cause&nbsp;a
                                lot of damage because it can change the contents
                                of your hard disk as well as use up your memory.
                                They can spread very&nbsp;quickly, usually by
                                shared storage devices or email attachments.
                                Ideally, you should never share storage devices.
                                You should never open an email attachment unless
                                you know&nbsp;and can trust where it comes from
                                (by checking a digital certificate, for
                                example). Attachments to be especially careful
                                of&nbsp;include file names ending in .exe .bat
                                .pif .scr and .vbs. Other types of viruses
                                include ‘Worms’ and ‘Trojan horses’. Worms are
                                programs that can spread themselves via
                                vulnerable&nbsp;network connections. They are
                                standalone programs, unlike viruses, which
                                ‘piggyback’ on other programs. In addition

                                particularly nasty one called MSBlaster affected
                                computers worldwide in August 2003. It spread
                                very quickly, hunting&nbsp;for computers on the
                                Internet without a firewall. When it found one,
                                it jumped into the computer through the
                                open&nbsp;communication port and infected it
                                without the user knowing - until their PC closed
                                down every time an Internet connection&nbsp;was

                                programs. They, too, can cause major problems
                                for your computer.

                                You should always have an anti-virus program on
                                your computer and you need to ensure that the
                                virus patterns are always up-to-date. Updating
                                virus patterns typically happens at least once a
                                day. An up-to-date anti-virus program will catch
                                most viruses, worms and trojan horses most of
                                the time.

                                <strong>Spyware and adware</strong>
                                <br />
                                These are both types of malicious software
                                (called 'malware' for short). Spyware is the
                                name given to software that gets access to your
                                computer without you knowing, often because you
                                have downloaded and installed free software from
                                the Internet. Spyware can change the settings on
                                your computer and interfere with or slow down
                                your internet experience. Spyware can also
                                gather information silently about your computer
                                habits and personal information and transmit
                                them to unauthorised people. Adware is software
                                that gets access to your computer, again usually
                                because you have downloaded free software from
                                the Internet or you have downloaded legitamate
                                software but it cam bundled with adware. You
                                often have the option to not install adware when
                                installing any software so be careful about just
                                clicking OK - OK - OK when installing new
                                software! Always check to see if there is a
                                screen that is asking if you want to install
                                extra software that has nothing to do with the
                                main software. Adware can cause adverts to pop
                                up on your screen or in your browser and can add
                                adverts to whatever browser you are using and
                                can be very annoying.&nbsp;

                                You should frequently run software designed
                                specifically to identify and destroy spyware and
                                adware. Two such programs are:

                                This is a term used to describe when criminals
                                try to get hold of your credit card details or
                                other personal information by&nbsp;pretending to
                                be someone they are not over the Internet. They
                                do this by sending out bogus emails e.g.
                                pretending to be from a&nbsp;bank and asking you
                                to confirm passwords for security reasons or by
                                setting up a web site that looks like it is a
                                legitimate&nbsp;business and luring you into
                                entering personal data, perhaps by advertising
                                very cheap prices for goods. Despite
                                numerous&nbsp;warnings that organisations never
                                ask for personal details by email, and reminding

                                previously or can&nbsp;retrieve information

                                computer as such but many people block cookies
                                on their computer&nbsp;because they don’t like
                                the idea that information is being collected

                                being sent back to&nbsp;the websites that they
                                visit. Websites now have to legally ask your

                                When you request a website from a web browser,
                                it is sent to your computer using a set of
                                standards known as http. This is not secure so
                                somebody potentially could intercept this
                                communication and see what has been requested.
                                If you are sending, for example, your personal

                                for criminal activities, such as stealing from
                                your bank or identity theft. To prevent this,
                                companies use the https protocol rather than the
                                http one. https stands for Hyper Text Transfer
                                Protocol Secure and is the secure version of
                                http. If you are using an https website then you
                                can reasonably expect that you are communicating
                                with the website you were intending to
                                communicate with and that any communications are
                                encrypted automatically so can't be intercepted
                                and used by criminals.

                                You should assume that at all times on a public
                                network, someone else is watching what you have
                                on your screen and can see all of your
                                communications.&nbsp;When you use a free local
                                hotspot with wifi on a phone, tablet or laptop,
                                your communications are especially vulnerable.
                                Anyone on these types of unencrypted networks,
                                with the right freely available software, can
                                capture the packets of data that make up
                                communications across networks and can steal any
                                information you send or receive. It is also
                                perfectly possibly for an unscrupulous criminal
                                to set up what appears to be a free local
                                hotspot for you to use, which you unwittingly
                                connect to. They can then easily see everything
                                you are doing on your computer. It is very
                                important to only use encrypted communications
                                across any public network and to use https at
                                all times for anything sensitive. However, the
                                best course of action is to not use public
                                networks for anything at all that is sensitive.

                                <strong>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</strong>
                                <br />
                                Many people go on holiday, go travelling or go
                                on business these days and they need constant
                                access to the Internet. We know that this
                                presents a serious security risk so what can
                                people do. The best solution by far is to ensure
                                that
                                <em>
                                  <strong>all communications</strong>{" "}
                                </em>
                                between you and whatever websites you are using
                                on a public network or a network that you cannot
                                trust are encrypted. The best solution is to
                                rent a Virtual Private Network service. This can
                                cost just a few pounds a month. What happens
                                when you sign up is that you download and
                                install some client software. When you go to a
                                public hotspot and log on, the client software
                                makes contact with the VPN service and your
                                computer and the VPN exchange security keys, to
                                verify to each other that you are authentic.
                                Once this has been done, all of your
                                communications are encrypted and go via the VPN
                                service. Apart from encrypting everything, the
                                VPN service masks your IP address. This can be
                                useful if you want to watch your favourite
                                program on catch-up TV via the Internet whilst
                                on holiday but you can only do so if you are in
                                the UK.

                                Of course, it is possible for the VPN service to
                                intercept your communications if they wanted
                                to.&nbsp;Companies and individuals who are
                                concerned about this check carefully in the
                                Terms and Conditions whether a VPN company logs
                                communications. Most don't but the weak link in
                                any 'secure' system are the employees, who could
                                do something unauthorised or illegal if given an
