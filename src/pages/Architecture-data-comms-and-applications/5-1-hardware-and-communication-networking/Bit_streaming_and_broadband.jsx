                                <br />
                                Streaming, is when you click on a link to a
                                video or song, for example. The video is sent to
                                you from a specially set up 'streaming server'
                                as opposed to a web server, and it sends you a
                                part of the video at a time. That part then
                                plays and while you are watching it, the second
                                part is sent, and then played when the first
                                part has finished. Part three is sent while you
                                are watching part two, and so on. This continues
                                until all the parts have been sent and played.
                                As long as your Internet connection can download
                                data fast enough (in other words, you have a
                                high enough 'bandwidth'), you should be able to
                                watch the video without it stopping or
                                stop-starting all the time. If your Internet
                                connection is slow, you may experience problems.
                                When you have finished watching the video, you
                                won't have a copy on your hard drive. If you
                                want to watch it again, you have to click on the
                                link and stream it again.

                                Bandwidth is the term used to describe the
                                volume of data that can be sent or received. It
                                isn't the speed of data, but the amount of data,
                                the volume of data.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                If you think of a water pipe for a moment. A
                                small diameter pipe will allow only so much
                                water to flow through it. If you have a bigger
                                diameter pipe, more water can pass through it.
                                In both cases, the speed that the water travels
                                is the same, it's just the volume of water that
                                passes a particular point differs. The same idea
                                can be applied to bandwidth. The better your
                                Internet connection, the higher your bandwidth,
                                and the more data you can send and receive. You
                                always need a good Internet connection if you
                                are downloading video, and certainly, you need a
                                high bandwidth connection if you want to stream
                                video. Broadband is excellent for this but a
                                dial-up modem wouldn't be. If you are in a
                                school with a lot of people streaming video or
                                downloading music, then you need a very high
                                bandwidth connection to the Internet.
