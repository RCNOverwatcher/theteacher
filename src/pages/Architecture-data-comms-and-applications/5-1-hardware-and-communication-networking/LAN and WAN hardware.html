                            To link the computers together in a network, you
                            would need to buy some interconnections. This might
                            simply be some cable but you could also use a
                            wireless technology to connect the computers
                            together. With any interconnections, you need to
                            think about:
                          </p>

                                  <strong class="strong">Cost</strong>. How much
                                  will the interconnections cost?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  <strong class="strong">Bandwidth</strong>.
                                  What bandwidth will users of the network need?
                                  Bandwidth is the term used to describe the
                                  amount of data transmitted across a network.
                                  Transmitting data such as music or video is a
                                  high bandwidth activity. Transmitting
                                  word-processed documents is a low bandwidth
                                  activity. Different interconnections are able
                                  to carry different bandwidths. A network
                                  designer needs to identify what users will be
                                  using the network for and then select an
                                  appropriate connection method. If users will
                                  be using video conferencing, then a coaxial
                                  cable (like a television cable) or a fibre
                                  optic cable, for example, could be selected
                                  because these can handle a high bandwidth. A
                                  wireless interconnection might be selected for
                                  a school, so long as the users just wanted to
                                  use basic applications such as word
                                  processing, databases and so on. If the users
                                  wanted good Internet access, the wireless
                                  solution might be discarded in favour of a
                                  cable solution for bandwidth reasons. That
                                  said, the bandwidth for wireless connections
                                  has improved considerably recently.

                                  If bandwidth isn't an issue, a wireless
                                  technology might be preferred in situations
                                  where physically laying cables might be a
                                  problem, for example, where lots of buildings
                                  needed to be connected and you don't want to
                                  dig up roads! Distances also need to be
                                  considered. Different interconnections can
                                  send signals different distances. It may be
                                  necessary to buy some extra equipment called
                                  repeaters to boost signals if transmission
                                  distances are too large.

                                  subject to electrical interference from any
                                  electrical devices because the data itself is
                                  electrical in nature. This is not so for fibre
                                  optics, which use light pulses to send data,
                                  not electrical signals. In locations where
                                  there is a large possibility of electrical
                                  interference, fibre optic technology could be
                                  considered.

                                  Wireless technology is insecure. It is
                                  relatively easy with the right equipment to
                                  'capture' the data sent in this way. Cables
                                  are more secure but can also be tapped into
                                  although in both cases, encryption technology
                                  should be used if data is that sensitive.
                                  Fibre optic technology is difficult to tap
                                  into - the light signals degenerate if someone
                                  tries to break into the signal.

                            do this, you will need to buy and fit a network card
                            for each computer. The network card inside a

                                </li>

                            Networks could also make use of wireless network

                            Computers on a client-server network are known as
                            clients. The clients need a very high-specification
                            computer to organise and manage the communications
                            around the network and to take responsibility for
                            controlling access to the files held centrally. This
                            high-specification computer is known as a
                            <strong class="intext">server</strong>, and for a
                            quality client-server network, you will need to go
                            out and buy a server. Although a server is just like
                            a normal computer it does have a huge hard disk
                            compared to the clients. This is because it needs to
                            store everyone's data files as well as store
                            applications centrally. The server will also have
                            much more RAM than the clients and a very fast
                            processor, to enable it to work as quickly as
                            possible. The server will usually have some kind of
                            automated back-up hardware, to ensure that users'
                            files are backed-up regularly.

                            The server on its own is not enough. You need to
                            also buy some software to allow the server to
                            organise and manage the communications around the
                            network and to allow the server to take
                            responsibility for controlling access to the files
                            held on its hard disk. This software is known as the
                            'Network Operating System', or NOS. Typically, the
                            NOS controls access to the facilities on the network
                            by making a user log in. They do this by providing
                            each user with a user ID and a password, which they
                            then have to type in when they want to use the
                            facilities of the network.

                            <strong>An Internet connection</strong><br />If you
                            want your LAN to communicate with other networks via
                            the Internet (so your LAN is part of a WAN), then
                            you need some further equipment. Connections to the
                            Internet can be done in a number of ways. One
                            increasingly out-dated way is to set up a ‘dial-up
                            connection’. The network is connected to a modem and
                            the modem is connected to a phone line. Then, when
                            you want to send an email or use the WWW, the
                            network dials up a phone number and makes a
                            connection to the ISP (see below). You can then send
                            or receive data. When you have finished, you
                            disconnect the connection. The modem turns the
                            digital signals of the LAN into the 'analogue'
                            signals of the phone line, and reconverts analogue
                            signals received back into digital signals for the
                            network. Modems have limited bandwidth and the
                            connection to the Internet is not permanent. In
                            addition, if you are using an office phone line for
                            your dial-up connection then that line cannot be
                            used for anything else, such as making a phone call
                            or sending a FAX. Of course, you could always go to
                            the expense of having another phone line put in.

                            <strong>Broadband</strong><br />Modems used in
                            dial-up connections work at speeds of up to 56
                            Kbytes. This may be fine for light Internet use.
                            However, a broadband connection gives much higher
                            bandwidths, which means you can download more data
                            every second – ideal if you download or upload lots
                            of multimedia files or a lot of people are using the
                            same connection, for example, in an office. A
                            broadband connection is also always on – you don’t
                            have to ‘dial-up’ a connection when you want to use
                            the Internet. Because it is always on, you should
                            ensure you have a firewall installed. A firewall is
                            a piece of software which stops unauthorised
                            external users gaining access to your network.
                            Another advantage of broadband is that you can use
                            the broadband connection to access the Internet at
                            the same time as sending or receiving phone calls.
                            You can’t do this with a dial-up connection. It is
                            either one or the other!

                              authorisation</strong
                            ><br />
                            A Firewall, according to the British Computing
                            Society's 'A Glossary of Computing Terms', "is a
                            computing program used in a large computing system
                            to prevent external users (even if authorised)
                            getting access to the rest of the system. Network
                            users' access is restricted to a small part of the
                            system and the firewall software prevents a user
                            (including unauthorised users) accessing data or
                            executing any programs in the rest of the system".
                            When a user on a network wants to access data or
                            applications held in a main server, it sends a
                            request for the information. The request is
                            intercepted by the firewall program sitting in a
                            proxy server. A proxy server is simply a server that
                            has been set up to control access to the main
                            server. The firewall program will look at the
                            request and the information about the user that is
                            automatically attached to it. It then checks both
                            that the user is valid and that they have the right
                            to the information they are requesting. It is able
                            to do this because it holds a database of all the
                            users and their associated rights - it just needs to
                            look up its database! If the request is valid, then
                            the firewall will send a message to a proxy server
                            to retrieve the requested data. The proxy server
                            will then access the data from the main server and
                            pass it out through the firewall to the user. The
                            user cannot access the main server directly but must
                            go through the firewall and proxy server.

                              LAN</strong

                            Many computer networks are set up so that users can
                            dial into them to retrieve files and use their
                            resources. To prevent only authorised users dialling
                            into the network, a firewall program on a proxy
                            server can be used. A user dials in to the network
                            with a user ID and password. The firewall looks at
                            these and also looks at the other information
                            automatically attached to the request, such as the
                            individual's IP address. Using all of this
                            information, it attempts to authorise the user. If
                            the user can be validated, then access is granted.
                            The user, however, will continue to work through
                            this firewall and proxy server and will not have
                            direct access to the network itself.

                            Of course, if you want to connect a network to the
                            Internet then you need an Internet Service Provider
                            (ISP) account. This is a company that acts as a door
                            to the Internet. You sign up with an ISP for a fixed
                            monthly or annual fee and they then allow you to
                            access the Internet through them. You need an ISP
                            for dial-up connections, broadband and leased lines.

                            Single computers are relatively easy to set-up, use
                            and maintain. You could probably set up a new game
                            on a PC, connect a peripheral and load up the
                            software for it, run anti-virus software and so on.
                            Things become much more complicated when you have a
                            network. Someone needs to set up the network, track
                            down faults, set up user accounts, deal with
                            security, keep track of licences, set-up software,
                            manage the resources on the network such as disk
                            space and so on. Network managers are people who
                            have the skills to do these things. It has become a
                            highly complex job and can be a well-paid job, too.
                            If you are a company then you have to think
                            carefully about the extra costs involved in
                            maintaining the network, and that might include
                            hiring an expensive Network Manager.
