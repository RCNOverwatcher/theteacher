                                <strong>Introduction</strong>
                                <br />A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network
                                where the workstations are 'close' together. It
                                isn't strictly defined in terms of an exact
                                distance but it is usually thought of as
                                computers in the same room, or building or even
                                in a number of buildings, which are next to each
                                other. A Wide Area Network (WAN) is where the
                                workstations are 'further apart' from each other
                                compared to a LAN. For example, the computers
                                may be spread out over a town, a country or the
                                world (like the Internet is). A small
                                accountant's business or a school probably have
                                a LAN whereas a bank or a large travel agents
                                company will have a WAN, as they have branches
                                across the country and across the world, each
                                with computers that can communicate with each
                                other.

                                      LANs are spread over a smaller area
                                      whereas WANs are spread over a larger
                                      area.

                                      WANs are usually made up of LANs connected
                                      together.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      LANs are usually much faster than WANs.
                                      LANs can usually send much bigger volumes
                                      of data in a second (known as 'bandwidth')
                                      than a WAN.

                                      Users generally share hardware on a LAN.
                                      On a WAN, however, the focus is all on
                                      communicating and sharing data.
