                            If you were to meet the Queen, for example, you
                            would be expected to follow protocol. You would be
                            expected, for example, to call her Ma'am' or 'Your
                            Majesty'. You might be expected to bow and to dress
                            appropriately as well. A set of rules that you have
                            to follow is known as a 'protocol'. Computers make
                            use of protocols as well, to enable them to
                            communicate.

                            Devices need to communicate. For example, a printer
                            needs to send messages to a computer telling it that
                            it has run out of paper or that it is ready to print
                            while a computer needs to send the data it wants to
                            print to the printer.

                              can work at or the printer will get very confused

                            Internet can function. When two devices want to
                            successfully communicate, they must agree to follow
                            some rules about the way they will do it. These are
                            known as protocols.

                            A communications protocol is the phrase used to
                            describe a set of rules that communication equipment
                            adhere to when they send data to each other. If two
                            devices are sending and receiving data but using
                            different rules then the receiving device will not
                            understand what was sent!&nbsp;A communications
                            protocol needs to specify a range of things before
                            successful communication can take place. These
                            include:
