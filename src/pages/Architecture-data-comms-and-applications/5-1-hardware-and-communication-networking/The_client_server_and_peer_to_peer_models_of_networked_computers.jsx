                                <br />
                                There are two many types of network that we
                                should know about. The first one is known as a
                                'client-server' network. The second type is
                                known as a 'peer-to-peer' network.
                              </p>

                                <strong>Client-server network</strong>
                                <br />
                                In a client server network, one computer has
                                been set up to be a 'server' (often called a
                                'file server'). The server's main job is to keep
                                the network secure. It does this by keeping a
                                database of users who are allowed to login to
                                the network and use it. Users who are authorised
                                can login using a login and password. They can
                                then use the software applications and hardware
                                such as printers on the network. Some users may
                                be given more 'rights' to use different things
                                on the network than others. These are known as
                                'access rights'. On your school network, for
                                example, you will be able to login and use quite
                                a lot of the network but your teachers, when
                                they login, will be able to access parts that
                                you cannot get to or may be able to use a
                                certain printer that you cannot print to. This
                                is because they have different access rights.
                                Servers usually have lots of hard disk space
                                because they securely keep all of the authorised
                                users' files on their hard disk rather than
                                having the files stored locally on the
                                'clients'. They also have lots of RAM, because
                                they have a lot of work to do and may need to
                                have a lot of applications open at any one time.
                              </p>

                                The 'clients' on a client-server network are the
                                individual computers that authorised users log
                                into and use. They are like the customers of the
                                server and an authorised user can usually login
                                to any of the clients on the network and use
                                them.

                                <strong>Peer-to-peer network</strong>
                                <br />
                                This type of network doesn't have a server.
                                Instead, all of the computers on the network
                                have equal status (they are peers of each
                                other). Each one can communicate with all of the
                                others and each of them may have a role in
                                helping to manage the whole network. For
                                example, one computer could send a file to
                                another computer and have it saved on that
                                computer. A computer might send a file to be
                                printed to another computer, which has a printer
                                attached to it.

                                These types of networks are quite simple and are
                                fine for very small networks of about 10
                                computers or less. They aren't complicated to
                                set-up but don't provide very many of the
                                powerful features found in client-server
                                networks. For example, client-server networks
                                can provide sophisticated security from one
                                point (the server) whereas security has to be
                                set-up on individual computers on a peer-to-peer
                                network (because they are all peers). You can
                                back-up work easily on a central server but you
                                have to back-up work on each computer in a
                                peer-to-peer network.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
