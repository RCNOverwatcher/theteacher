                                <br />A networks is a complex system. To ensure
                                that it runs smoothly and to ensure that
                                everyone involved in running the network (the
                                network manager and technicians, for example)
                                know whose job it is to do what, a network will
                                have a number of written policies in place.
                                These will have been drawn up by the network
                                manager, usually after consulting with everyone.
                                They include Acceptable Use, Disaster Recovery,
                                Back-up, Archiving and Failover policies.

                                <br />
                                People who need access to a network to do their
                                job are usually asked to sign an agreement that
                                they will only use it for legitimate reasons
                                related to doing their job before they are
                                allowed access. They also have to agree not to
                                use it for illegal, unethical or for
                                time-wasting activities, such as downloading
                                copyrighted material, viewing pornography or
                                spending time on social networking sites if it
                                is not work-related. The agreement they have to
                                sign is known as an Acceptable Use policy. This
                                policy helps reassure an organisation, who is
                                responsible for the network and what people are
                                using it for. It also means that an organisation
                                can reasonably sack someone who uses the network
                                for anything other than work-related activities
                                as the user was clearly informed in advance what
                                the consequences would be.

                                <strong>Disaster Recovery policy</strong>

                                All networks might have a disaster. This could
                                range from the entire building holding a network
                                burning down to flood damage to malicious damage
                                by a hacker or disgruntled employee. When a
                                disaster happens, an organisation needs to get
                                the network back up and running as quickly as
                                possible or it might go out of business.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                A Disaster Recovery policy is a written
                                document, which attempts to get the managers in
                                an organisation to think in advance about what
                                they need to do should a disaster happen. By
                                thinking ahead and planning for the worst,
                                companies will know what to do quickly and
                                calmly in the event of a serious problem. They
                                should be able to identify suitable back-up
                                strategies in advance by thinking about what
                                data needs to be recovered. They will be able to
                                design tests to test the robustness of the
                                Disaster Recovery plan to check it is viable.
                                They will limit the possibility of legal action
                                against them for doing the wrong thing in a
                                panic!
                              </p>

                                There isn't a single specification for a
                                Disaster Recovery policy, but it might include
                                measures to reduce any threats in the first
                                place (for example, by installing burglar
                                alarms, fire sprinkler systems, firewalls,
                                robust authentication procedures, having
                                Acceptable Use agreements in place and so on.
                                Then it might include measures to detect threats
                                in the course of the normal working day, for
                                example, by checking error logs, by security
                                guards doing checks and by random checks on
                                employees to see what they have been doing on a
                                computer system. And finally, there are the
                                measures thought about to recover from a serious
                                problem. This might include everything from
                                having an insurance policy in place, to checking
                                that the back-up systems work, to knowing where
                                to go and what information is needed and where
                                it is kept (off-site) to rebuild a network from
                                nothing and get it back into the position the
                                company was in before e.g. a fire burnt their
                                building down

                                All data is at risk at all times. There are many
                                reasons why this is so. A hacker or disgruntled
                                employee may delete data, there could be a fire,
                                data might get corrupted by software or an
                                upgrade, a piece of equipment like a hard drive
                                might fail, there might be an earthquake or
                                other natural disaster, someone might steal a
                                computer with data on and so on. To ensure that
                                data can be recovered, it is backed-up
                                regularly. However, a policy is written down to
                                make it crystal clear;

                                Back-ups are usually done on a rolling basis.
                                For example, in the first week of a four week
                                back-up plan, an 'incremental back-up' might be
                                made every night on a back-up tape called
                                Monday1, Tuesday1, Wednesday1, and Thursday1. An
                                incremental back-up resaves only those files
                                that have changed since the last time a back-up
                                was made. On the Friday, a 'full back-up' is
                                made of the whole system' data on a tape called
                                Friday1.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Then the above is repeated for the next week on
                                tapes called Monday2, Tuesday2, Wednesday2,
                                Thursday2 and Friday2, so you now have 10
                                tapes). The same is done for week three and week
                                four (so you have 20 tapes now). Then at the
                                start of the new four week period, the tapes are
                                over-written and the whole process restarts.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                The above policy might be fine for a small
                                organisation. For larger ones, you would
                                probably keep back-ups going back many months or
                                even years. The reason why so many back-ups are
                                made is that it might actually take a few weeks
                                or months to detect that there was a problem
                                with the back-up system. If you used just one
                                tape and backed up a computer every day on that
                                one tape, it would be a real problem if you
                                discovered, for example, that the back-up device
                                hadn't been working correctly for a few weeks or
                                a back-up tape was faulty.

                                Sometimes, you don't want to have certain files
                                on your system anymore but you don't want to
                                just delete them, or you are not allowed to
                                legally. For example, when a year group leaves
                                school to go to university or start a job, you
                                don't need their details to be on a school's
                                admin system anymore. If a company has finished
                                doing its tax and accounting records for one
                                year, they won't be needed again by the company,
                                but they can't delete them in case the tax
                                office wants to check them (companies have to
                                keep tax records for seven years by law). Plane
                                makers might have to refer to their records of
                                components in a plane decades after a plane was
                                built if there was a plane crash. They don't
                                want the details of these components on their
                                current system but they may possibly need them
                                in the future.

                                Having old data on a system slows down searches,
                                slows down back-up times and needs hard disk
                                space. Data that is no longer currently required
                                therefore is 'archived'. That means:
                              </p>
                              <ul style="list-style-type: disc">

                                      The data is 'compressed' - squashed to
                                      make it as small as possible.
                                    </li>

                                      It is copied to a storage device e.g.
                                      online storage or on a back-up tape.
                                    </li>

                                      It is properly labelled with a date and
                                      details of the archive.
                                    </li>

                                      If the back-up is a tape or similar, it is
                                      put in safe storage e.g. a fire safe or a
                                      safe in a bank, for example.
                                    </li>

                                      The original data on the system is
                                      deleted.
                                    </li>

                                Back-ups and archiving may seem similar but they
                                are not. They are done for completely different
                                purposes and in completely different ways.
