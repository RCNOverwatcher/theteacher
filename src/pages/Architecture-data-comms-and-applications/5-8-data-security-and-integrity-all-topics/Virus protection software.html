                            />A virus is a software program written by someone
                            on a computer in a programming language and then
                            sent across the Internet by email or spread by
                            people sharing storage devices.&nbsp;They are
                            sometimes designed to do nothing more than annoy
                            (like making your keys beep each time you press one
                            on your keyboard) but they often do a lot of damage
                            such as wiping your hard drive clean or allowing
                            your computer to be accessed by a hacker remotely or
                            allowing a hacker to control your webcam!
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            You often hear people advising you not to open or
                            double-click attachments sent with an email unless
                            you are absolutely sure where the email came from.
                            If you do, you might install a virus on your
                            computer. If you are lucky, your computer will be
                            set up to check all of your emails and any
                            attachments you open, but a virus might still get
                            through your computer's defences.&nbsp;Microsoft
                            have identified the file extensions in the table to
                            be a potential threat to your computer. A file
                            extension consists of the three letters that you can
                            see after each file name e.g. myHoliday.doc or
                            NotVirus.exe . If you can't see the file extension
                            in an email or in your file manager, then it is
                            because that feature has been switched off and you
                            need to switch it on.&nbsp;In Windows, you usually
                            have to go to My Computer - Folder Options - on the
                            View tab, remove the tick next to 'Hide file
                            extensions for known file types' and then click on
                            okay. It does vary between Windows operating systems
                            but the process is similar for all of them.&nbsp;

                            />There are all kinds of tricks that hackers use to
                            try and get you to open an email attachment.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            1. An email arrives telling you that your computer
                            is infected with the latest virus in the news, and
                            offers to remove it - all you have to do is click on
                            the removal program attached! When you open the
                            attachment, it disables your antivirus program and
                            firewall. Then it installs a virus and reports to
                            you that your computer is virus-free. The virus can
                            then get to work.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            2. Your friend sends you a file called
                            greatGame.exe". You friends says they've played it
                            and it's great so you open the attachment by
                            double-clicking on it. The problem is,&nbsp;it
                            contains a delayed action virus along with the game.
                            You might get to play the game but now your computer
                            has a virus. And all because you thought your friend
                            knew what they were doing!
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            3. An email arrives that seems to come from
                            Microsoft. The Microsoft heading and icons are
                            correct and it looks real. The email tells you to
                            patch your copy of Windows immediately as there is a
                            security threat to your computer. The patch is
                            attached to the message and as soon as you
                            double-click it, you've disabled your firewall and
                            anti-virus programs and installed a virus! It was a
                            'spoof' email, not from Microsoft.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            4. Attackers can hide malicious attachments by using
                            double extensions, e.g. "answers.txt.lnk" or
                            "great_picture.gif.vbe". *.lnk, *.vbe and several
                            other extensions are usually hidden. The file names
                            you see are "answers.txt" or "great_picture.gif".
                            When you double-click on them, you install a virus
                            because .ink and .vbe can be used to do just that.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The above illustrates that the advice about never
                            opening an attachment unless you really know where
                            it came from and who sent it to you is very good
                            advice!
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The other main way of catching a virus is by sharing
                            back-up devices like a pen drive. When you plug
                            someone else's pen drive into your machine, if it
                            has a virus, it could jump from their pen drive to
                            your computer and infect your computer. When you
                            plug a pen drive into your computer, the virus then
                            jumps to it. If you take it to your friend's house,
                            for example, and then plug it into their computer,
                            the virus will jump to their computer, and so it
                            spreads very quickly. Again, if you are lucky, your
                            computer might stop the virus but on the other hand,
                            it might not.&nbsp;
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Anti-virus software is used to help protect your
                            computer against viruses. It does this by checking
                            potential viruses e.g. a file that you have
                            double-clicked on from an email, against patterns of
                            known viruses that it keeps in its database. If it
                            finds a match, it quarantines the virus or deletes
                            it and then tells you.&nbsp;As thousands of new
                            viruses are written every week, it is important to
                            ensure that virus patterns are kept up-to-date. This
                            can usually be done automatically. There are free
                            versions of anti-virus software and there are also
                            many paid-for versions as well. These often come
                            with many additional features and support if there
                            is a problem.
