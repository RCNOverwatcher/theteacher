                            <strong>Introduction</strong><br />A hacker is
                            someone who tries and sometimes succeeds in getting
                            access to computer systems to which they have no
                            right of access. They are attempting to get
                            unauthorised access to data. They do this for a
                            variety of reasons, including just to prove they
                            can, or for fun but also, to view it for 'secret'
                            information, or to steal it for personal gain.&nbsp;

                            ><br />People who try to gain unauthorised access to
                            computer systems are known as black hat hackers.
                            They are essentially criminals, trying to bypass
                            security measures so that they can access files of
                            data for malicious or criminal reasons. They might
                            want to view data, change it, delete it, steal it to
                            resell it, steal it to make it public or steal it to
                            use themselves to make money. When a black hat
                            hacker finds a vulnerability in a network, they keep
                            this information to themselves as it is very
                            valuable; it will let them into the system any time
                            they want until the flaw is found, reported and
                            blocked by others.

                            <strong>White hat hacking</strong><br />White hat
                            hackers are often called
                            <strong><em>ethical hackers</em></strong
                            >. They are not trying to break into a system for
                            malicious or criminal reasons. They are attempting
                            to break into a system perhaps because they own it
                            and want to test how secure it is, or perhaps
                            because they are employed by a security company to
                            test a system's levels of security by running
                            penetration tests. They are open about their
                            activities with others in their team, document their
                            findings and help the process of making data and the
                            systems they live in more secure.

                            <strong>Penetration hacking</strong><br />A
                            penetration test is a deliberate attack by a white
                            hat hacker on a computer system, with the aim of
                            finding security weaknesses in it. This might
                            include anything from actually gaining unauthorised
                            access to data at different security levels, gaining
                            access to a system's software so that the white hat
                            hacker can run functions such as searching through
                            data, or finding weak pathways into other systems
                            from the system they are probing.

                          <p>
                            Tests may be designed using a white box or black box
                            approach (you may recall that these terms were
                            discussed when we looked at the topic of testing in
                            Systems Analysis). White box penetration tests are
                            where the hacker has lots of information about the
                            target system, such as the type of computers that
                            are being used, the software that runs on them,
                            perhaps some information about how security is
                            organised who who is responsible for it. Black box
                            penetration tests are where the company is
                            considered to be inside a black box and all the
                            hacker knows is what the company's name is. They
                            don't know any other details except those that they
                            can find out for themselves.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Penetration tests should help identify the strengths
                            and weaknesses of a target computer system and the
                            potential threats that could result from an attack.
                            This information can be used to inform a company
                            about further measures they need to take to improve
                            their data and system security and can be used to
                            justify allocating a budget for this purpose.
