                                <br />
                                Generally speaking, you should always keep
                                systems software such as operating systems
                                updated, to ensure that all potential security
                                problems are blocked and your software is more
                                stable. You could also be taking advantage of
                                improved drivers and updated features, for
                                example. Whether or not you want to update
                                applications is a personal choice. Some people
                                take the view that they will only apply minor
                                updates, bug fixes and security updates because
                                they like the software just as it is. They don't
                                want to do a major upgrade, which will change
                                the layout of their favourite software (and they
                                may be charged for a major update) and mean they
                                have to spend time learning new things again
                                instead of actually just using the software.
                                Whatever you decide to do, there are a number of
                                particular issues to be considered when updating
                                files online.

                                When you try to update some software, things
                                don't always work out. Sometimes, the update
                                just doesn't work for unknown reasons.
                                Sometimes, you are missing a piece of software
                                or hardware that is required for the updated
                                versions to work. Sometimes, some other software
                                you are using interferes with the updates and
                                sometimes, you don't have the necessary driver
                                software for the new software to function
                                correctly. Another issue you may have is that
                                your computer crashes in the middle of an update
                                and corrupts the software, or there is a power
                                cut with similar consequences. Your WiFi may
                                stop working all of a sudden. You are usually
                                only going to find out there is a problem once
                                you have installed and updated the software!
                                Problems you could experience after the update
                                include the updated software suddenly not
                                working or other applications suddenly not
                                working, to more serious problems with the
                                operating system suddenly not working as it
                                should.

                                Before you attempt to update anything, it is
                                always a good idea to ensure first and foremost
                                that all of your personal files are backed up to
                                the cloud or a sperate back-up device. You
                                should also set a restore point in your
                                operating system if it allows you to, so that
                                you can roll back your computer to how it
                                currently is if you have problems with an
                                update. You could also take a system image. This
                                is a complete snapshot of your hard drive,
                                including the operating system, all applications
                                and all settings. If your hard drive fails, or
                                stops working as a result of an update, you can
                                install a new hard drive and then simply reload
                                the system image. You can be up and running
                                again in five minutes after installing a new
                                hard drive compared to the days it might take
                                you to find and reload all the software you were
                                using, recover all personal files and set up
                                everything again, such as your Internet
                                settings.

                                An untested system image is not something you
                                can rely on. You should always prove the image
                                works (and prove to yourself that you know how
                                to do this). You can test it by swapping the
                                current hard drive for a spare, and then using a
                                recovery disk to install the system image. If
                                you don't know how to do this, you should spend
                                the time finding out - watch a YouTube
                                video!&nbsp;Some of these precautions may seem
                                over-the-top for a home user. However, if you
                                suddenly lose access to your computer, or a
                                company suddenly loses access to their network
                                or their commercial data, it could lead to
                                serious problems.

                                know and can trust. If you start trying to
                                update files from any old website, how do you
                                know that you are not downloading and installing
                                modified files with malware? Many leading
                                software manufacturers have systems in place
                                that allow you to check for updates on their
                                servers and to download and install updates from
                                them automatically. You should always use this
                                facility where it exists.

                                  Try 'proxy server'. When you go online, all of
                                  your activities will be strongly encrypted
                                  after you have set up an account and
                                  downloaded a small piece of 'client' software
                                  onto your computer. When you request a
                                  website, that request will then be encrypted
                                  and the results returned to you will be
                                  encrypted. On top of that, who you are (your
                                  IP address) will be stripped out of all
                                  requests so that you can't in theory be
                                  traced. If there is a security breach at the
                                  proxy server or VPN company, however, then it
                                  certainly would be possible. VPN software
                                  usually works on all platforms, including
                                  Windows, Mac and Linux PCs, laptops, tablets
                                  and phones. Have a look at&nbsp;
