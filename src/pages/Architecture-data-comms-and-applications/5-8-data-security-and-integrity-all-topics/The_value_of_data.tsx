                                Think for a moment about the different kinds of
                                data that is held by a company. It could
                                include, for example, information&nbsp;about who
                                your customers are, who owes you money, who you
                                owe money to, current orders, information about
                                orders you&nbsp;are trying to win, details about
                                your staff, how much they're paid, meetings that
                                have been arranged and so on. Imagine if
                                it&nbsp;disappeared! What would the consequences
                                be?
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                <strong>Why is data valuable?</strong>
                                <br />
                                Data is valuable for a number of reasons. It
                                takes time to compile, a long time! It takes
                                time to input the data into the
                                computer.&nbsp;To recompile data or re-enter it
                                into a computer is expensive because you have to
                                pay someone to do it, when they could
                                be&nbsp;doing something far more productive for
                                your company. You need information about an
                                order placed with your company so&nbsp;that you
                                can process the order and then be paid for it -
                                that's how your company makes a profit! You need
                                to know when to pay&nbsp;your bills and taxes so
                                that you don't get taken to court. You need to
                                be able to chase up people who haven't paid you
                                so that&nbsp;you can pay your bills and keep
                                trading.
                              </p>

                                <strong>Commercial data is valuable</strong>
                                <br />
                                If you were running a supermarket and you lost
                                the data in your stock control system, you
                                wouldn't know what you had on the&nbsp;shelves.
                                You wouldn't know when you needed to re-order
                                stock and you would lose money while you sorted
                                out the problem.&nbsp;If you kept historical
                                data on your supermarket's computer and you lost
                                that, you would lose valuable information
                                about&nbsp;product trends, what sells well and
                                at what times and doesn’t sell very well, for
                                example. This would have an effect on
                                your&nbsp;business's potential to maximise their
                                profits.&nbsp;If you were in the business of
                                offering loans to people, you would want to be
                                able to check their financial background
                                before&nbsp;you handed over any money to them,
                                in case they had a criminal record for fraud,
                                for example! If credit agencies suddenly
                                lost&nbsp;all of their data, then loan companies
                                wouldn’t be able to ask them about individuals
                                who have applied for loans. Imagine
                                if&nbsp;credit companies lost all of their data!
                                They wouldn’t know who owed them money. If you
                                were in the business of data&nbsp;warehousing or
                                data mining (see later in this section) then
                                losing your data would be catastrophic. Your
                                whole business is&nbsp;based on having
                                historical data to work with!&nbsp;Take this
                                opportunity to review a backup strategy that a
                                company might employ to protect their data.
                                Remind yourself about&nbsp;the need for a
                                written procedure, about what information would
                                go in a procedure and what hardware might be
                                used in a&nbsp;backup regime.
