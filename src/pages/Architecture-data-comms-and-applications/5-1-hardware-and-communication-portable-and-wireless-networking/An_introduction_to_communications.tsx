                                A computer sitting there by itself is all well
                                and good. It is fairly easy to set up and manage
                                a single computer.&nbsp;You can load up new
                                applications on to it. You can do your homework,
                                play games, listen to your CDs and play your
                                films on DVD. &nbsp;There are some limitations,
                                though. For one, you can't email your friends or
                                contact them in other ways, for example, using
                                Skype or another video chatting application. Not
                                being able to communicate in this day and age is
                                a real downside. Another big problem is that you
                                can't share files or use online software and you
                                can't share hardware. For example, you can't
                                work on your homework in a word processor and
                                then just go to the other computer and get the
                                file back from it (unless you started
                                transferring files on to pen drives, which all
                                takes time). And if you had two 'standalone'
                                computers (ones that aren't connected to other
                                computers), then each one would need its own
                                printer to print out work. Again, you could mess
                                around copying files from one computer to
                                another on a pen drive, or unplug and then plug
                                the printer into the computer you need to print
                                from, but this is a lot of messing around.

                                It would be much better to be able to connect
                                computers together so they can communicate with
                                each other. If you create a 'network' of
                                inter-connected computers (called 'clients'),
                                you can send and receive email and other
                                communications and you can share files, software
                                and hardware.

                                A network is simply more than one computer that
                                has been connected together so they can
                                communicate. A computer that is part of a
                                network is often called a 'client' when you are
                                talking about networks. If you had three
                                standalone computers, how would you make a
                                network?
                              </p>

                                  1) You would need to buy a network card for
                                  each computer. (They are sometimes called
                                  'network adapters'). You have to fit a network
                                  card into a slot inside the computer. A
                                  network card gives your computer a unique
                                  address on the network, just like a postal
                                  address. It also provides a socket so you can
                                  connect some network cable to it.
                                </strong>
                                <br />
                                <strong>
                                  2) You need some cable. You could use
                                  wireless, but for the moment, we'll just stick
                                  to a simple, traditional network that uses
                                  cables.
                                </strong>
                                <br />
                                <strong>
                                  3) We need a box called a 'switch'. Actually,
                                  all this does is act a bit like a postman; it
                                  redirects messages to and from the correct
                                  computer.
                                </strong>

                                  4) You connect the network cards up to the
                                  switch using cable.
                                </strong>

                                <strong>
                                  5) You then get a 'server'. The server is
                                  actually just another computer. It's usually
                                  very powerful with a big hard drive and lots
                                  of RAM because you are going to store all the
                                  software on the server and everyone's personal
                                  files.
                                </strong>
                                <br />
                                <strong>
                                  6) You connect the switch to the server using
                                  some of your cable.
                                </strong>
                                <br />
                                <strong>
                                  7) You connect a printer to the server using
                                  some more of your cable so that everyone can
                                  print out. note that you only need one printer
                                  because all the computers on the server can
                                  share hardware.
                                </strong>
                                <br />
                                <strong>
                                  8) Finally, we want an Internet connection, so
                                  we connect a modem (or a 'router', a 'modem
                                  router', or a 'wireless modem router') to our
                                  server using yet more cable.
                                </strong>
                                <br />
                                <strong>
                                  9) Finally, our network has to be managed and
                                  controlled, so we need a 'Network Operating
                                  System' or NOS for short. This will manage the
                                  computers (the clients), create login accounts
                                  for security and take care of all of the
                                  communications around the network.

                                That's it. All networks follow the above design,
                                more or less. you school network will almost
                                certainly be similar to the above.&nbsp;Users
                                with an account can now log in, send each other
                                messages and use other forms of communication
                                and share files, software and hardware.

                                Networks are more complicated than standalone
                                computers so you might have to employ a Network
                                Manager if your network grows large. you also
                                have to buy extra software and hardware for them
                                like network cards, cable and network operating
                                systems. But the benefits of networks nearly
                                always outweigh these extra costs.

                                <strong>a)</strong>
                                If you want to connect to the Internet, you have
                                to have an account with an ISP. What does ISP
                                stand for? <br />
                                <strong>b)</strong> Search the Internet for 'ISP
                                UK'. How much does it cost roughly on average
                                for a household to have an account each month so
                                you can access the Internet?
                                <br />
                                <strong>c)</strong>
                                Are all ISPs the same? If you had to decide
                                which one to choose for your household from the
                                hundreds of companies, what kind of criteria
                                might you use?
