                              <p>
                                <strong>Q1.</strong>&nbsp;NFC stands
                                for&nbsp;Near Field Communication.
                                <br />
                                <strong>Q2.</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth = 10 meters
                                &nbsp;NFC = 4 cm.
                                <br />
                                <strong>Q3.</strong>
                                Data transfer speed of Bluetooth = 24 Mbps
                                &nbsp; NFC = 240 Mbps.
                                <br />
                                <strong>Q4.</strong> To send a photo to a
                                friend's phone:&nbsp;the first thing to do is
                                switch the NFC on in both phones via the
                                settings. Then you select a photo. Then you hold
                                the two phones together for a second! That's it.
                                The connection is made and the photo will be
                                transferred to your friend's phone
                                automatically.
                                <br />
                                <strong>Q5.</strong>
                                An NFC tag is a programmable tag that can be
                                used to send out information or to make certain
                                actions happen on your phone, for example.
                                <br />
                                <strong>Q6.</strong>
                                To program an NFC tag, you need to have a phone,
                                a preformatted NFC tag and an NFC app for
                                writing programs. Apps for NFC tags are very
                                easy to use.
                              </p>

                                <strong>Extension tasks</strong>
                                <br />

                                These are practical tasks. There will hopefully
                                be enough students with NFC on their phones to
                                try out the practical things. NFC tags are not
                                expensive and packs are available from a wide
                                range of suppliers online. You could have a lot
                                of fun with these, putting them around school on
                                an open day, having some kind of quiz around
                                school and so on.
