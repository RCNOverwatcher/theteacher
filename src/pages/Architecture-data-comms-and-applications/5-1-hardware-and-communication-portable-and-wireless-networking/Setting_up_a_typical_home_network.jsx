                                Having an excellent Internet connect is now seen
                                as very important for many people. The members
                                of a family in a home today might have some or
                                all of the following: a number of different
                                computers, a laptop or two, some phones, perhaps
                                some tablet PCs, a smart TV, a content streaming
                                device and other pieces of equipment. All of
                                these might need an Internet connection to get
                                the best out of them, or even just for basic
                                functions.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Before we describe how a typical home network,
                                we should know that every piece of hardware that
                                we can use across a wireless network, every
                                phone, laptop and tablet PC, for example, has
                                what is called a MAC (Media Access Control)
                                address in its settings. Have a look for your
                                phone's MAC address - it's there somewhere! It
                                typically looks like this:
                                <strong>bf : b5 : 2a : ce : 4d : a1</strong>.
                                Each MAC address is unique and before you set up
                                a home network, it is a good idea to collect all
                                of the MAC addresses of the devices you want to
                                allow to use the network together. These can
                                then be used to add another layer of security to
                                your network.&nbsp;
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                A typical home network might look like the
                                diagram.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                <strong>a)</strong> One of the main computers in
                                the house has a network card.
                                <br />
                                <strong>b)</strong>
                                This is connected by a cable to a wireless modem
                                router, which is itself connected to the phone
                                line by a cable.&nbsp;
                                <br />
                                <strong>c)</strong> The router has some driver
                                software that has been loaded up onto the
                                computer so that the router can work.
                                <br />
                                <strong>d)</strong>
                                The router has some 'Administrator' software
                                that comes with it. This is opened on the
                                computer.
                                <br />
                                <strong>e)</strong>&nbsp;In &nbsp;the settings,
                                a name is chosen for the network you are about
                                to create and a&nbsp;password is also chosen.
                                <br />
                                <strong>f)</strong>
                                There will be a section called 'Access Control'
                                or similar somewhere in the software. The MAC
                                addresses of the devices you want to allow to
                                access the network are entered in this section.
                                <br />
                                <strong>g)</strong>
                                You save these settings and you are done!
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                To connect a phone, laptop or any other wireless
                                device, you simply select the name of the
                                wireless network from the list of networks that
                                the device can see and enter the password. If
                                your MAC address is in the router's list, you
                                will be given wireless access. If your MAC
                                address is not in the list, you won't, even
                                though you know the password!&nbsp;MAC addresses
                                are a very powerful way of making sure that only
                                those devices you know about can get access to
                                your wireless connection. After all, you don't
                                want just anyone to use your Internet as you
                                don't know what they are doing! If they are
                                doing something illegal, it might be traced back
                                to your Internet connection and your house!

                                <strong>Q1.</strong> Why is it important to set
                                up security properly on a home network?
                                <br />
                                <strong>Q2.</strong>
                                What does 'MAC' stand for?
                                <br />
                                <strong>Q3.</strong>
                                What is a MAC address?
                                <br />
                                <strong>Q4.</strong>
                                What is meant by 'Access Control' on a network
                                and how are MAC addresses used to achieve this
                                on a home network?
                                <br />
                                <strong>Q5.</strong> How do you know what the
                                name of a network is and the password for the
                                network that you want to use?
                              </p>
                              <p>

                                <br />
                                <strong>a)</strong>
                                Find out the MAC addresses of all the devices
                                you own which have wireless access. They will
                                all have a MAC address - you just have to find
                                it. If you are struggling, type into Google
                                something like 'Where is the MAC address for
                                Nokia 34GLK phone'.
                                <br />
                                <strong>b)</strong>
                                If you have a home network, ask whoever set it
                                up at home if they used Access control. If they
                                are not sure, they probably didn't. Ask them to
                                open the Administrator software and have a look.
                                They could even then add this extra layer of
                                security. They need to collect together all the
                                MAC addresses of devices they want to allow
                                before they begin.
                              </p>
