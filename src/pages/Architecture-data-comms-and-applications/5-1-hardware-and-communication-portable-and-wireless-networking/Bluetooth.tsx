                                <strong>What is Bluetooth?</strong>
                                <br />
                                Bluetooth is a technology that allows you to
                                share data between devices over short distances,
                                usually up to about 10 metres. Like wifi, you
                                don't need any wires to connect the devices but
                                a big advantage of Bluetooth is that you don't
                                need a wireless router! One Bluetooth device can
                                make direct and secure contact with another
                                device directly without having to go through
                                another device. In fact, the official Bluetooth
                                specifications state that you connect seven
                                devices at once to yours using Bluetooth.
                                However, practically speaking, three to four
                                devices is the limit as any more than that and
                                performance is often greatly reduced. The
                                Bluetooth chip is found in many different places
                                today, from phones, to cameras, GPS units,
                                laptops, tablets and so on and can be used, for
                                example, to send messages and transfer or stream
                                files such as photos, music and video.

                                <strong>Making a connection</strong>
                                <br />
                                Connecting devices (or pairing them, as it's
                                usually called) involves you making your device
                                'visible' or 'discoverable' to other Bluetooth
                                devices by ticking a box in the settings. You
                                usually give your device a name as well. This
                                means that other devices can now see
                                yours.&nbsp;If your friend wants to pair their
                                phone with yours, they select your phone from a
                                list of discoverable devices (which will include
                                yours). They will be given or have to select a
                                passcode to enter. A request is then sent to
                                your phone and you confirm that it's okay to
                                pair, confirming or entering the same PIN on
                                your phone as your friend used. If you want to
                                send a file to someone, you then just select the
                                file and select the option to send it via
                                Bluetooth. You will be given a list of names of
                                the other Bluetooth devices you're paired to,
                                select the target device and the file will be
                                sent automatically.

                                Bluetooth can act as a drain on the power of a
                                phone so it's a good idea to only have it
                                enabled when you need to use it. You can set up
                                'trusted' devices so that you don't have to keep
                                going through the authentication process each
                                time you want to send a file to a particular
                                person. Bluetooth is usually set up so that your
                                device is discoverable for only a short window
                                of time, typically two minutes but you&nbsp;can
                                also make your device 'undiscoverable' so that
                                you will only receive requests to pair and make
                                connections with people you want to. Bluetooth
                                is considered a very secure method of
                                communication.

                                <strong>Bluetooth uses</strong>
                                <br />
                                There are lots of uses for Bluetooth, apart from
                                pairing phones and sharing files. You can
                                transfer photos from your camera to a laptop
                                without having to set up messy wired
                                connections. You can connect your phone to a
                                hands-free set in a car so that you can answer
                                and make calls safely (and legally). you can
                                stream music from a phone or MP3 player to a car
                                radio. A search of the Internet should reveal
                                many other applications.
