                                Satellites are used widely for communication in
                                the media, navigation, video conferencing, data
                                transfer and for military purposes, for example.
                                A transmitter on the ground sends signals to a
                                satellite using microwaves or some other form of
                                transmission. Using a different frequency to
                                avoid interference, the signals are then
                                redirected back to the planet. If it doesnâ€™t
                                reach the intended recipient, it is then bounced
                                to other satellites and on to its destination.

                                  communication

                                <br />
                                If you transfer data using satellite technology,
                                the cost of data transfer is not dependent on
                                distance. A short distance transfer costs the
                                same as a long distance one. Overall, the cost
                                of transfer is higher than non-satellite
                                methods. Satellites can handle a very high
                                number of simultaneous communication lines (they
                                can handle a large bandwidth). Satellite
                                communications can be used in the remotest parts
                                of the world, from the arctic to mountainous
                                areas to deserts although the actual equipment
                                is very expensive. One use of this technology
                                has been to provide up-to-date educational
                                materials for schools in remote parts of Africa.
                                Because of the distance between the surface of
                                the planet and the satellites, there is a short
                                delay in any communication. Weather conditions
                                can also affect the quality of transmission.

                                You can connect up networks without using
                                cables! For example, you can use lasers to
                                'fire' data signals between different parts of a
                                network or use radio signals to send information
                                across a LAN. You could use lasers to link two
                                buildings onto one network, for example. Of
                                course, you must have a clear view between the
                                sending and receiving equipment in each building
                                or the laser signal will be blocked.

                                Consider a school. The school has a couple of
                                computer rooms linked using UTP. What happens
                                when one department wants to use a computer room
                                and it is booked? What happens when a teacher
                                wants to use the computers in their own area
                                rather than the computer room? One answer is to
                                use wireless technology to provide a 'roaming
                                computer room' like this:

                                      Buy laptop computers. Most laptops these
                                      days have a wireless card in them.

                                The beauty of this system, also known as
                                <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>, is that you can move the
                                laptops around the school to different
                                departments (so long as you have remembered to
                                install a transceiver there). You also don't
                                have to worry about cable installation. One
                                drawback is that the bandwidth of these systems
                                may not perform as the main part of the network
                                does. For example, you should be able to run
                                generic applications such as a word processor or
                                a spreadsheet but multimedia or
                                bandwidth-intensive Internet applications may be
                                slower than networks that use physical
                                connections. They also suffer from electrical
                                interference problems far more than cable-based
                                networks and they are potentially very insecure!
                                Signals can be easily intercepted if the network
                                has not been set up with security in mind. If
                                this is a problem for an organisation than it
                                should consider other technologies or think
                                about encryption, perhaps PGP.

                                or Media Access Control address. When setting up
                                a secure wireless network, you need to know the

                                with. When you have this number, you have to

                                administration login account. You then add the

                                allowable MAC addresses. The router will then

                                network, usually by giving them a password.
                                These types of wireless network are known as
                                'Hotspots' and you can find them everywhere
                                these days, from MacDonalds and Starbucks to
                                airports and schools. Sometimes they are free
                                and sometimes you have to pay. If you are
                                setting up your own hotspot, the password chosen
                                should be a good, long one using a mixture of
                                upper and lower characters, numbers and

                                Microwaves are radio signals in the spectrum of
                                1 - 30 GHz. Connecting computers and networks
                                together over a distance is easily possible
                                using microwave technology. Microwaves have a
                                high bandwidth, much bigger than those used in
                                lower frequencies in the radio spectrum.
                                However, the sending transmitter and receiving
                                equipment do need to be able to see each other
                                in a line-of-sight so there will be problems if
                                there is a building in the way. They also suffer
                                from problems due to the atmosphere; the signal
                                can degrade in certain weather conditions.
                                Although microwave technology is established and
                                proven, there is a high cost to building the
                                towers for the sending and receiving equipment.
                                The distance that the signals can travel is up
                                to about 40 miles so for longer distances, extra
                                relay towers have to be built to collect, boost
                                and resend the signals. Building towers can be
                                an issue as planning consent is often needed to
                                erect them.

                                Microwave networks are ideal as part of
                                satellite communication networks, and to connect
                                islands, mountains, remote countryside and other
                                hard-to-reach places.
