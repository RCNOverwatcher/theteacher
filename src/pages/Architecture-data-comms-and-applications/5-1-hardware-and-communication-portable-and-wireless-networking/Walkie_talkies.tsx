                                </strong>
                                <br />
                                Walkie-talkies are transmitters/receivers that
                                can send and receive voice signals in the form
                                of radio waves. A handset is typically a little
                                bit bigger and heavier than a mobile phone and
                                you can usually see a short aerial sticking out
                                of it. Unlike cellular phones, you cannot talk
                                and listen at the same time. You can only do one
                                or the other and for this reason walkie-talkies
                                are an example of half-duplex communication.
                                You’ve probably seen people using walkie-talkies
                                on TV - they keep saying “Over” when they have
                                finished talking, to signal to the other person
                                that it is their turn to speak.

                                <strong>Radio frequencies</strong>
                                <br />
                                There are a fixed number of radio frequencies
                                that are available in any country. Some
                                frequencies are reserved for TV and radio and
                                some are reserved for mobile phone use. For a
                                mobile phone company to operate, they must buy
                                the right to use certain frequencies. They can
                                then have exclusive access to them and no other
                                company can use them. In this way, one company’s
                                phone calls will not interfere with another
                                company’s. There are some frequencies, however,
                                that are public. In Europe, there are 8 public
                                frequencies that can be used by anyone. You do
                                not require a licence to use them. Within each
                                of the eight frequencies, there are 38 ‘bands’
                                that can be used, making a total of 8 x 34 or
                                304 different communication channels.
                                Manufacturers of walkie-talkies make use of
                                these public communications channels in their
                                products and for that reason, the communications
                                are not secure - the chat across them can be
                                heard by anyone listening in!

                                <strong>Uses of walkie talkies</strong>
                                <br />
                                Walkie-talkies can form an ideal communications
                                network in certain circumstances. They can have
                                a range of up to two miles depending on the
                                model you buy and are ideal for security
                                personal to keep in touch in shopping centres,
                                clubs, festivals or on a factory site, for
                                example. They could be used to keep key people
                                who could be working anywhere in a building in
                                touch with reception. A Network Manager looking
                                after a computer network, for example, or a
                                maintenance person, could be anywhere in a
                                building but may be needed at short notice. They
                                would be ideal candidates for a walkie-talkie.

                                <strong>Pros and cons of walkie-talkies</strong>
                                <br />
                                Walkie-talkie handsets are cheap to buy and you
                                don’t need to then rent a phone line or airtime
                                or buy a SIM card or contract from any company.
                                Handsets use rechargeable batteries so are cheap
                                to run and they are small and highly portable.
                                We have already said that they don’t need to be
                                licensed and a company can have as many handsets
                                as they like using whatever public frequencies
                                they like. Because the handsets use public
                                frequencies, however, anyone can tune in to your
                                conversations so they are not suitable for
                                sending secure messages. Their limited range may
                                be a problem for some applications.
