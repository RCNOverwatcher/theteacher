                                  Many people have mobile phones now but how
                                  does a mobile phone network work?&nbsp;
                                </span>
                                A mobile phone is simply a radio that can both
                                send and receive voice sounds in the form of
                                radio waves. It can do this at the same time
                                because it uses one radio frequency to send
                                voice signals and a different one to receive
                                them. This is known as ‘duplex communication’.
                                Consider a country such as the UK and a mobile
                                phone company called Theteacher Telecom.
                                Theteacher Telecom will split up the country
                                into areas called ‘cells’. In the middle of each
                                cell will be a ‘base station’. The base station
                                is simply a radio transmitter/receiver. Base
                                stations will typically be positioned 500 metres
                                apart in cities but may be&nbsp;10 km apart in
                                the countryside.

                                When you switch on your mobile phone, your phone
                                listens out for a special signal that is
                                constantly being broadcast by the base stations.
                                This signal is known as the System
                                Identification Code, or SID. When your phone
                                picks up a SID signal, it then knows that it is
                                within range of a base station in a particular
                                cell. If it cannot receive this signal then it
                                displays a message on your phone that it can’t
                                find your network. This means you can’t make a
                                phone call! Assuming that your phone has
                                received the SID, your phone then transmits a
                                signal that identifies your phone and where you
                                are (which cell you are in). This signal goes
                                via a base station transmitter to the area
                                Mobile Telephone Switching Office, or MTSO. The
                                MTSO keeps track in a database of all the phones
                                that are in that MTSO area at that time and
                                which cell they are in.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                When you want to make a phone call, the MTSO
                                will allocate your phone a unique pair of
                                frequencies to use from the hundreds it has
                                available for the duration of the call. When you
                                make a call, you will send your voice on one of
                                these frequencies via the base station’s
                                transmitter in the cell you are in to the MTSO.
                                The MTSO will then relay your call to the
                                destination using the normal Public Switched
                                Telephone Network, the PSTN. The PSTN is the
                                normal land-based telephone system that we use.
                                When you listen to someone talking, the process
                                is reversed using the other frequency you were
                                allocated.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Whilst you are making a call, the strength of
                                your radio signal is being monitored. The
                                transmitter in the cell you are in as well as
                                the transmitters of the adjacent cells do this.
                                If you move towards the edge of a cell, your
                                radio signal will reduce. As you cross into a
                                new cell, your phone call will come under the
                                control of a new transmitter and leave the
                                control of the transmitter of the cell you were
                                just in. This happens reasonably seamlessly as
                                this change is coordinated by the MTSO. You may
                                have noticed, though, that when you are in a
                                train, for example, the signal does diminish
                                sometimes. This is the effect of you moving to
                                the extremes of a cell’s boundary and the limit
                                of a particular transmitter.
                              </p>

                                <strong>Are mobile phone networks safe?</strong>
                                <br />
                                It has been known for a long time that radio
                                waves can cause a heating effect on the body and
                                can affect the efficiency of the nervous system.
                                This had led to mounting speculation on the
                                effects of mobile phones. Whilst people working
                                with powerful radio waves have complained of
                                problems in the past, mobile phones use very low
                                power radio waves. To investigate the problems
                                associated with mobile phones, the Government
                                set up an independent enquiry called the Stuart
                                Enquiry. The scientists reported in May 2000 and
                                found: that there was little evidence that
                                mobile phones caused health risks but that this
                                may be due to gaps in their knowledge and the
                                fact that the long-term effects of low power
                                radio waves are not documented; they
                                acknowledged that radio waves do affect cells in
                                the body but this may not necessarily result in
                                a health problem; children’s bodies are
                                developing and they may therefore be more
                                susceptible to health risks than adults; mobile
                                phone companies should publish the SAR value of
                                each phone. This is a measure of how much radio
                                energy a type of phone transmits to the body;
                                there was no evidence as yet of any damage to
                                people living close to a base station; drivers
                                are at risk of accidents if they use their
                                phones whilst driving and should be encouraged
                                to use hands-free sets. Various reports have
                                recently indicated that pupils in schools may be
                                at risk from both WIFI signals and from the
                                radio signals from their phones. Reports can be
                                found e.g. on the
