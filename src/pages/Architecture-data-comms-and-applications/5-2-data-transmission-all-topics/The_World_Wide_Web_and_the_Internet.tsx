                                The Internet is part of many people's lives
                                across the globe now. It is used for
                                socialising, education, business, news reporting
                                and so on. It has so many uses that it is
                                difficult now to imagine life without it.

                                <strong>What is the Internet?</strong>
                                <br />
                                The Internet is a set of networks, both Local
                                Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks
                                (WANs) which are connected together usually
                                using telecommunications facilities. These
                                include the phone lines but also such
                                communication technologies as satellite.

                                The Internet allows everyone to communicate
                                quickly and allows the transfer of files and
                                data between computers. Data (an email, a file
                                or a web site, for example) starts at one
                                computer. It is broken down into digital
                                'packets' of information. Each packet is then
                                passed through other computers, with each packet
                                often going by a completely different route to
                                the other packets. When all the packets reach
                                the final destination, they are reassembled into
                                the original communication and can then be read.

                                <strong>World Wide Web</strong>
                                <br />
                                The World Wide Web (WWW) is often used
                                interchangeably with the 'Internet' but it does
                                have a different meaning. The WWW is a
                                collection (a very large collection) of
                                information held on the Internet in multimedia
                                form. This includes text, pictures, video, sound
                                and animations.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                <strong>Web pages and web sites</strong>
                                <br />
                                The information on the Internet is stored in
                                'web pages' and the web pages are themselves
                                stored at places known as 'web sites'. Web pages
                                can be very large so you often need to scroll
                                down to be able to read them. A set of web pages
                                on one web site can be very large so they are
                                usually broken down into different web pages and
                                linked together using 'hyperlinks', which are
                                also known as 'hotlinks'. These can also be used
                                to link to other completely different web sites.
                                Because any individual web site can be large, it
                                usually has a 'home page'. This is usually the
                                starting point for any web site and helps the
                                user quickly find their way around and navigate
                                through the rest of the web site.
                              </p>

                                <strong>Browsers</strong>
                                <br />A 'web browser' is a type of application,
                                which has been written by an individual or
                                organisation to allow a user to get back and
                                display multimedia information on the Internet.
                                It can be used to surf the WWW as well as to
                                provide other facilities, such as transferring
                                individual files. Web pages sent over the
                                Internet use a communications protocol known as
                                http. This isn't secure so that if anyone
                                intercepts these pages, they can view them. You
                                can send and receive encrypted web pages over
                                the Internet using the communications protocol
                                known as https. This is important if you are
                                sending or receiving sensitive information e.g.
                                logging into your bank account. Browsers
                                typically have a range of features, such as
                                navigation tools, to move forward and backwards
                                between web pages, facilities to save web pages
                                or print them out and security features, for
                                example, the facility to block certain web sites
                                or block certain types of file. Examples of
                                Browsers include Firefox , Chrome, Sahara and
                                Explorer but there are many many others. Try
                                doing a Google search for web browsers and
                                download and try out some of the less known ones
                                at home.

                                <strong>Intranet</strong>
                                <br />
                                One word you may come across from time to time
                                is 'Intranet'. An Intranet is very similar to
                                the Internet, except that it exists purely
                                within a company or other organisation. A
                                company's Intranet is only accessible by
                                authorised users, usually by using a system of
                                logins, passwords and access rights (as opposed
                                to the Internet, which anyone who has a
                                connection can access). It allows a company to
                                distribute information only to its own
                                employees, information that it might not want
                                its competitors to have, for example.
                              </p>

                                <strong>Extranet</strong>
                                <br />
                                Sometimes, an Intranet will allow part of itself
                                to be viewed by the public from the Internet.
                                This means that part of a company's Intranet
                                could be used to advertise itself. If a part of
                                an Intranet is accessible via the Internet then
                                this part is sometimes called an 'extranet'.
