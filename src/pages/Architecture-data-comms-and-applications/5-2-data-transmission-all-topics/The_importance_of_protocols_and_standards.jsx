                                would be expected to follow protocol. You would
                                be expected, for example, to call her Ma'am' or
                                'Your Majesty'. You might be expected to bow and
                                to dress appropriately as well. A set of rules
                                that you have to follow is known as a
                                'protocol'. Computers make use of protocols as

                                Devices need to communicate. For example, a
                                printer needs to send messages to a computer
                                telling it that it has run out of paper or that
                                it is ready to print while a computer needs to
                                send the data it wants to print to the printer.
                                Computers need to send data between themselves
                                so that, for example, email can be exchanged and
                                the Internet can function. When two devices want
                                to successfully communicate, they must agree to
                                follow some rules about the way they will do it.
                                These are known as protocols.

                                A communications protocol is the phrase used to
                                describe a set of rules that communication
                                equipment adhere to when they send data to each
                                other. If two devices are sending and receiving
                                data but using different rules then the
                                receiving device will not understand what was
                                sent!&nbsp;A communications protocol needs to
                                specify a range of things before successful
                                communication can take place. These include:

                                important, a special organisation known as the
                                ITU, or International Telecommunications Union,
                                exists to lay down the exact detail in the
                                standards that everyone will use. They define
                                the protocols. The two basic protocols used on
                                the Internet are IP (Internet Protocol) and TCP
                                (Transmission Control Protocol). Together, they
                                are referred to as the TCP/IP. TCP/IP controls
                                how information is successfully transferred
                                between computers on the Internet. When web
                                pages are requested and then sent over the
                                Internet, another protocol used in addition to
                                TCP/IP is the http protocol, or Hyper Text
                                Transfer Protocol. When files are transferred
                                over the Internet, the FTP protocol, or File
                                Transfer Protocol, is used. Sending email can be
                                done using the SMTP, or Simple Mail Transfer
                                Protocol.
