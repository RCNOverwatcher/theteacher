                                <strong>Introduction</strong>
                                <br />
                                There are three main tpyes of technology for
                                storage. These are solid state, magnetic and
                                optical.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                <img
                                  style="float: left"

                                />
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                <strong>
                                  Solid state devices (Flash devices)
                                </strong>
                                <br />
                                Solid state devices have no moving parts. That
                                means they can't get worn out and are not quite
                                as easily damaged by bangs and knocks as optical
                                and magnetic devices. They store store data in
                                binary patterns using billions of tiny switches.
                                Another point to note about solid state devices
                                is that they need very little power to work and
                                can get the power that they do need from the
                                device that they are plugged into. Examples
                                include, SD cards, micro SD cards and pen
                                drives. Many computers and laptops are now being
                                sold with solid state hard drives. Although
                                typically much smaller (and cheaper) than
                                magnetic hard drives, they are so much faster! A
                                solid state hard drive can breathe new life into
                                an old laptop.

                                <strong>Magnetic devices</strong>
                                <br />
                                These store binary data patterns as billions of
                                magnetised areas on a disk. These areas can be
                                read from or written to by a special head that
                                moves over the magnetic area. With hard disk
                                drives and floppy disk drives, the disk spins
                                very quickly (thousands of times a second)
                                whilst the head moves over the magnestised
                                areas, reading from and writing data to the
                                disk. One of the things to look out for if you
                                ever have to buy a new hard drive is how fast
                                the disk or disks spin (hard disks often have
                                more than one disk inside them) - the faster
                                they spin, the quick reading and writing data
                                can take place so the faster your computer can
                                work.

                                <strong>Optical devices</strong>
                                <br />
                                Optical devices store binary patterns using
                                lasers. The lasers shine onto a disk and change
                                whether an area on it can reflect light or not.
                                The laser can then be used to read back patterns
                                by shining a laser on the disk and looking at
                                which areas reflect light and which don't. Some
                                types of disk can be written to just once,
                                although you can read from them many times.
                                These are known as 'WORM' storage devices (Write
                                Once Read Many). CD-ROMs, DVDs and Blu-ray disks
                                are examples of WORM disks. They are often used
                                by manufacturers to distribute software. Other
                                media, such as CD R/W can be written to many
                                times as well as read many times.
