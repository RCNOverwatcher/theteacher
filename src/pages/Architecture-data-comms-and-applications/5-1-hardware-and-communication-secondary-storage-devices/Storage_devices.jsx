                                Storage devices are known as 'non-volatile'
                                devices. This is because when the power is
                                removed from the device, the data files remain.
                                These devices are long-term storage. They are
                                perfect for backing-up files and applications,
                                transporting them and sharing them. If you
                                didn't have storage devices, you would have to
                                reload applications and re-enter files each time
                                you switched your computer back on! There are
                                lots of different types of storage device to
                                choose from.&nbsp;

                                The disks are in fact not floppy at all but hard
                                magnetic disks, each with their own read/write
                                head that moves over the disk that they are
                                responsible for. We already know that they spin
                                very quickly when compared to floppy disks but
                                hard disks constantly spin, as opposed to floppy
                                disks, which start spinning only when they are
                                needed for a read or a write operation. No time
                                is wasted, therefore, waiting for a hard disk to
                                get up to speed before you can use it! Both of
                                these reasons explain why floppy disks work much
                                slower than hard disks. Hard disks, like floppy
                                disks, are direct access devices - you can go
                                straight to a file on an area of disk without
                                having to go through all the other files first.
                                Hard disks are used to store applications and
                                data files. They can hold huge amounts of data
                                compared to a floppy disk. A typical hard disk
                                today might hold 80 Gbytes of data but bigger
                                disks seem to come onto the market every few
                                months! All personal computers have hard disks,
                                although it is possible for workstations on a
                                network to exist without a hard disk - they make
                                use of the server's hard disk to store
                                applications and data. These types of computers
                                can be referred to as 'thin clients'. Hard disks
                                can also be used as back-up devices. A computer
                                can be fitted with a second hard disk known as a
                                mirror hard disk or a 'raid' data storage
                                system. As the name suggests, this second hard
                                disk is used to keep an identical copy of the
                                main hard disk. Then, if the main hard disk
                                fails (and every hard disk, indeed every storage
                                device, will fail sooner or later), you can use
                                the mirror disk to recover your applications and
                                data with the minimum of effort.

                                <strong>Magnetic tape</strong>
                                <br />
                                Magnetic tape can hold lots of data, of the
                                order of Gigabytes. They are used typically to
                                back-up data files on networks. Network servers
                                often have a back-up device fitted in the server
                                that can hold 7 tapes, for example. These rotate
                                automatically each day. The back-up process is
                                automated, so that in the middle of the night,
                                data is backed-up on a new tape and the tape
                                gets ejected from the device. The Network
                                Administrator then removes the tape in the
                                morning and puts it in a fire safe. Magnetic
                                tape is not a direct access device. It is a
                                serial access device. If you lost one of your
                                files and asked the Network Manager to recover
                                it from a back-up tape, they would have to
                                search through every file until they found the
                                right one. They couldn't go straight to the file
                                in question. For this reason, magnetic tapes are
                                very slow devices, not suitable for fast access
                                applications but ideal for applications where
                                you won't probably need the data - like back-up
                                applications! They are also cheap to store data
                                on compared to other types of media. You can
                                store more bytes per penny!

                                <strong>CD-ROM</strong>
                                <br />
                                This media is ideal for distributing software
                                because they hold a lot of data (650 Mbytes or
                                more) compared to floppy disks (1.44 Mbytes) and
                                nowadays, most computers have a CD-ROM drive. It
                                is much more convenient having software on one
                                CD than having lots of floppy disks because you
                                don't have to keep changing the media when
                                installing the software. One CD is also less
                                bulky than lots of floppy disks. CD-ROMs are
                                direct access media but they do not use magnetic
                                technology! They are optical storage media. They
                                store information on pits in the surface of the
                                CD and then use a laser to scan over the pits.
                                CD-ROMs are read-only devices. The basic CD unit
                                is very cheap. However, you would need to use a
                                CD-R/W device and a special type of CD if you
                                want to write to as well as read from a CD, in
                                much the same way as you would read and write to
                                a floppy disk.

                                <strong>CD-R/W</strong>
                                <br />
                                This kind of optical, direct access media is
                                ideal for backing up personal files, especially
                                those involving multimedia. It is suitable for
                                this type of application because of the high
                                storage capacity of CDs. You need to have a
                                special CD-R/W device to write to CDs. The CDs
                                themselves could be of the WORM type (Write Once
                                Read Many times). This means that you can only
                                write to the CD once (sometimes called 'burning
                                a CD') but can read from it many times. This
                                might be suitable if you wanted to make a
                                back-up copy of some software you have bought or
                                wanted to make and distribute some music you had
                                recorded. CDs can also be Read-Write, which
                                means they can be written to many times in the
                                same way a floppy disk can be. A CD that has
                                been created using a CD R/W device can be read
                                from a standard CD-ROM device, usually after the
                                installation of a small utility program. CD-R/W
                                devices are now cheap to buy, of the order of
                                twenty to thirty pounds.

                                <br />
                                DVDs are rapidly replacing CDs (and video
                                tapes)! This optical, direct access, very fast
                                media can hold approximately 17 Gbytes of data
                                compared to the 650 Mbytes of a standard CD. A
                                DVD player can read CDs as well as DVDs with the
                                addition of extra software. They are typically
                                used for distributing multimedia, especially
                                high quality video. A DVD can store about 8
                                hours of high quality video! DVD recorders are
                                also available. Although they cost hundreds of
                                pounds their price will inevitably drop.

                                <strong>Compressing data</strong>
                                <br />
                                Data compression refers to the process of
                                'squashing' data so that you can store more of
                                it in the same space on a storage device. This
                                can be done by using a utility program from
                                within your operating system or using
                                applications such as WinZip. A lot of data sent
                                over the Internet is also compressed because
                                this reduces the amount of time (and cost) of
                                data transfer. It is compressed by the sending
                                computer and de-compressed by the receiving
                                computer. This happens automatically, without
                                the knowledge of the users.

                                <strong>Cloud storage</strong>
                                <br />
                                Many companies these days do not back up their
                                work onto a physical medium such as a tape or
                                DVD but use internet storage instead. When they
                                want to back something up, the data is first
                                compressed to make it smaller. It is then sent
                                over the Internet to a company, who stores it on
                                their computers. This has quite a few
                                advantages. You can set up the back-ups to
                                automatically happen so no one will forget to do
                                them. You don't need to buy expensive equipment
                                to back-up work and you can't lose back-ups. Of
                                course, you need an Internet connection and some
                                companies aren't happy about sending their
                                valuable data to another company to look after
                                for security reasons. However, this way of
                                storing data, known as 'cloud storage' is
                                becoming increasingly popular. Many cloud
                                storage companies offer a certain amount of free
                                storage to individuals. You could do a search
                                and start using cloud storage yourself!

                                For many years, floppy disks used to be the main
                                storage medium after the hard drive, although
                                these days, you would be unlikely to see modern
                                computer systems with one as they can hold so
                                little data compared to alternatives. Drives
                                typically cost less than ten pounds while the
                                disks themselves cost pennies. A disk typically
                                stores 1.44 Mbytes, or about one and a half
                                million bytes of data - you would struggle to
                                store one good quality digital song on one

                                      takes to access data. Magnetic tape, for
                                      example, is serial access and very slow
                                      whereas flash drives are direct access and
