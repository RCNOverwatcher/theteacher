                            <strong>Defragmentation utility</strong><br />When
                            you save a file or program on your hard disk or
                            other storage device, it is tempting to think that
                            it is all saved together.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            <img
                              style="margin: 20px; float: left"
                              src="images/2ca696bf-87e2-4111-b1f6-189678df7835defrag.GIF"
                              alt="defrag"
                            />Unfortunately, that is not usually the case. When
                            you save a file, the operating system looks at what
                            space it has free on the hard drive and then breaks
                            up the file into chunks. It then stores these chunks
                            all over the hard disk, in whatever spaces are
                            available. As long as the operating keeps track of
                            where these chunks are, it isn't usually a problem
                            because of the speed the CPU works at. Over time,
                            however, if too many files are spread over a disk,
                            it will start to take a long time to read those
                            files back. The hard drive is a mechanical device
                            that has moving parts. These moving parts have to
                            move to collect each chunk of a file when you want
                            to open it so that it can rebuild the file.The
                            operating system has a defragmentation utility
                            program that will reorganise these chunks so that
                            they are next to each other or as close to each
                            other as possible on the storage device. This will
                            make it faster to get back files and also free up
                            bigger spaces for files you save in the future.
