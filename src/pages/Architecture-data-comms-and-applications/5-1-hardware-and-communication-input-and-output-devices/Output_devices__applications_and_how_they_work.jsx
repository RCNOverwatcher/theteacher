                                copies can be made of a printout by using carbon
                                paper between sheets of paper (as opposed to
                                printing out two copies of something - there is
                                a subtle difference). This system is used by
                                credit card companies to produce actual copies
                                of receipts when a customer makes a purchase.
                                After a customer's credit card is swiped and
                                authorised, two identical copies of a receipt
                                are printed using small dot matrix printers.
                                Both copies are then passed to the customer, who
                                signs the top copy. This puts a carbon signature
                                on the bottom copy. The customer keeps one copy
                                and the shop keeps the other. You cannot make
                                actual carbon copies with ink-jets or laser
                                printers although of course you can print out

                                  Different ink-jet printers work in different
                                  ways. Canon printers, for example, heat up the
                                  ink so that it explodes in bubbles onto the
                                  paper. The characters are still made up of
                                  dots, but the dots are so small (of the order
                                  of 50 microns diameter - a human hair is about
                                  the same diameter) that you can't see them and
                                  tell them apart. The dots are accurately
                                  positioned together to create characters and
                                  images but of course, you can use the printer
                                  software for an ink-jet printer to order your
                                  printer to use more dots per inch (or DPI).
                                  This gives you a higher resoultion e.g. 1200
                                  by 800 DPI, very important for high-quality
                                  photos, for example but this uses more ink
                                  than lower resolution settings. If you are
                                  only printing out text, then 100 DPI is
                                  usually fine.

                                  Speakers work by sending an electrical current

                                  the sound you want to play. A coil that has a
                                  current flowing through it becomes an
                                  electromagnet, which is attracted and repelled
                                  by a permanent magnet (1). The parts above are
                                  all contained within a speaker cone (3) that
                                  has a thin membrane called a diaphragm (4).
                                  The constant act of the coil being magnetised
                                  and demagnetised causes the cone to 'pump'

                                  object. It does this by printing out very thin
