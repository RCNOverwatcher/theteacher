                                also be used to read back documents.

                                Vocabulary dictation systems have a number of
                                uses. They can be used to create text documents.
                                A person simply speaks into a microphone,
                                dictating a letter, for example, which can be
                                much faster than typing, especially if you
                                haven't been trained in typing.&nbsp;
                                <span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px">
                                  In addition, specialised dictionaries can be
                                  added to systems. For example, a legal
                                  dictionary or medical dictionary could be
                                  added to a voice dictation system to allow
                                  legal documents or medical documents to be
                                  easily produced. Without the additional
                                  dictionaries, the jargon used in these
                                  specialist areas couldn't be identified
                                  accurately and a lot of errors would be
                                  created, which can take a long time to track
                                  down and correct.

                                &nbsp;can also be used to create huge databases
                                of text from speech. Speech is captured through
                                microphones and then matched to written words,
                                which are saved to a database.

                                  Once speech has been turned into text, it can
                                  then be analysed using computers. Speeches can
                                  be easily analysed. For example, it is easy to
                                  cross-reference what major politicians have
                                  said (and promised) in the past because many
                                  of their speeches are digitalised now and can
                                  be searched for keywords.

                                <strong>Reading back</strong>
                                <br />
                                The reverse process is also possible, where
                                written text is read back though speakers or
                                headphones to a user. The quality of the voice
                                reading back can vary considerably. Free systems
                                often have voices that sound very computerised,
                                with accents and emphasis points in the wrong
                                places, if they are there at all. Things get
                                better when you start paying for commercial
                                systems but they are still far from perfect.
                                These kinds of systems can be used by people
                                with disabilities, to read back novels and other
                                literature. They can be used by authors, who can
                                have a computer read back what they have
                                written, so they can hear if it makes
                                sense.&nbsp;

                                Vocabulary dictation systems have many claims
                                written about them, usually from their
                                manufacturers, some of whom will regularly claim
                                99% accuracy. Many users of such systems
                                complain that this is an over-exaggeration, and
                                that it takes a lot of time to actually go
                                through what they have produced and find and
                                correct errors. In addition, a considerable
                                investment of time has to be made teaching voice
                                systems to recognise individuals and their way
                                of speaking, their pitch, volume, accents and so
                                on, and ambient noice and the quality of the
                                hardware used can cause additional problems.
                                Some people think they are wonderful and swear
                                that it saves them a lot of time.
