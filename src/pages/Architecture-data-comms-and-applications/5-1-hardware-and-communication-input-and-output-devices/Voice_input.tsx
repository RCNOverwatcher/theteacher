                                Voice recognition software is a program that
                                accepts your voice via a microphone to allow you
                                to enter commands or to allow you to enter data.
                                There are lots of different uses of voice
                                input.&nbsp;

                                Information systems can be used that accept
                                simple commands from a user and then gives them
                                back information. For example, if you ring up a
                                bank, they may have a system that asks you what
                                you want. They will give you some ideas of what
                                to say, for example, 'PIN', 'Balance',
                                'Mortgage', 'Savings and so on. Each answer is
                                analysed and will usually lead to a further menu
                                to narrow down your requirements. Eventually,
                                you will get to a recorded message giving you
                                the information you need, or you will be put

                                be prompted to say, 'Arrivals', 'Departures',
                                'Parking' and so on.

                                you simply speak your name and it is compared to
                                the voice print the company has of you. Once you
                                have been authorised, you are then put though to

                                with the software, to reduce the chance of
                                incorrect entries, but once this is done and you

                                recognition software, it can be very accurate.

                                Many computer systems including phones and

                                to use your voice to instruct the device to
                                carry out basic tasks, such as opening and

                                for example. Again, there is normally some
                                training involved, where you have to speak
                                commands into the software and the software'

                                and you have got used to the commands to use, it
