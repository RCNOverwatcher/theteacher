                                  Voice recognition is the term used to describe
                                  recognising a user by the characteristics of
                                  their voice and also comes under the umbrella

                                  Authentication, also known as verification, is
                                  the process of confirming someone is who they
                                  say they are.

                                &nbsp;This can be achieved by using voice
                                technology. A recording of a user's voice is
                                kept in a database and was set up when a user
                                first created an account. When someone claims to
                                be a certain person over the phone, their voice
                                'print' is retrieved. A sample is taken while
                                they are on the phone and compared to the voice
                                print. This will confirm that they are who they
                                say they are, or will flag up a potential
                                problem that requires further security checks.

                                <br />
                                This is similar but different to authentication.
                                Speaker identification is where a voice print is
                                taken over the phone, for example, and a
                                database is searched to try and find a match to
                                the voice print. If a match can be found then
                                the user can be identified. Often, a perfect
                                match cannot be found, although near-matches
                                can. The list of near-matches can be used to
                                quickly identify the user by running further
                                checks on this much smaller number of matches.

                                Voice prints can be processed in a number of
                                ways to try and find a match. The simplest
                                method involves a straight forward pattern
                                matching approach, where a person's voice is
                                mapped across to a stored pattern. If enough
                                points coincide, then a match can be confirmed.
                                Sohpisticated maths techniques are also used to
                                identify matches. These include looking at the
                                statistics of the variations in the pitch of the
                                voice and using neural networks, which build up
                                a map of points in the voice print and uses that
                                in a comparison algorithm.

                                Problems can occur if there is too much
                                background noise (also called 'ambient noise')
                                when the original voice print was taken, or when
                                a sample is taken for comparison to the original
                                voice print. The effect of this can be reduced
                                using noise reduction algorithms but are not
                                always successful. People change and so do their
                                voices. They may be ill, have a cold or have
                                gained or lost weight. They may be speaking from
                                abroad and the quality of the phone line may not
                                be so good or there may be time delays in the
                                speech. Users may be using different phones at
                                different times, for example, land lines and
                                mobile phones, and they may be using different
                                handsets that have different quality
                                microphones. Any of these factors may have an
                                impact on both the original voice print taken
                                for the database and any subsequent samples
                                taken for verification and identification.&nbsp;

                                Many companies use voice recognition to verify
                                users over the phone, including banks and
                                building societies. This reduces the cost of
                                employing people over time and speeds up the
                                processing of enquiries. The claim is that an
                                individual can have their voice sampled and can
                                then be picked out from a database of millions
                                of voice prints. Voice recognition has also been
                                used in the fight against crime and terrorism.
                                Voice prints are taken of terrorists posting
                                speeches on YouTube and to TV stations after
                                carrying out horrible crimes, for example, so
                                that they can be positively linked to them if
                                caught in the future.
