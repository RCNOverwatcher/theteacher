                                Big Data is a general term used for very large
                                and complex sets of data, so large and complex
                                that traditional data processing techniques are
                                simply not good enough to work on them. The data
                                may be structured or unstructured, but buried in
                                the data is information. If these large and
                                complex sets of data can be successfully
                                analysed, then this should lead to better
                                decision-making based on better information,
                                greater efficiences, cost reductions, deployment
                                of resources, allocation of budgets to maximise
                                profits and so on. The challenge is to analyse
                                and make sense of this data!

                                </strong>
                                <br />
                                There are lots of examples of large and complex
                                data sets. If you think about YouTube, Twitter,
                                Facebook and similar applications for a moment.
                                They are all being posted to by millions of
                                people in a day. What is being posted? What
                                products are people talking about? What
                                interests people? What do people in Cambodia
                                talk about compared to people in Ghana, the UK
                                or Japan? This might seem unimportant, but if
                                you know the answers to these types of
                                questions, you can start to target specific
                                groups of people with the same profile with far
                                more focussed advertising. You can target the
                                people who matter most! If companies like
                                Facebook can offer manufacturers a route to
                                people who have shown a real interest in their
                                products, they can charge the manufacturers a
                                premium for access to this information. They can
                                then run advertising on web sites' pages,
                                perhaps send SMS messages only to target groups,
                                post out free samples and offers and so on. The
                                manufacturers will be happy because they will
                                sell more of their products for less overall
                                cost; advertising and getting to the people who
                                are really interested in a manufacturer's
                                products is one of the most expensive and
                                difficult areas of a business.

                                Supermarkets buy many products and sell them
                                across their stores. The products are
                                continually changing. If they can build up a
                                history of those products across all their
                                stores and work out when those products are
                                likely to sell, they will be able to ensure that
                                exactly the right stock is on the shelf in the
                                right stores at exactly the right time. The
                                information about what sells and when may be
                                linked to specific events like Christmas,
                                Valentine's Day or Easter, for example, or
                                events such as the Olympics. It may be linked to
                                political events like elections, or what the
                                weather was like, or whether there was a Bank
                                Holiday. If they can make sense of all of this
                                information, they will gain a competitive edge
                                over their rivals, make more money, increase
                                profits and increase bonuses.&nbsp;

                                to forestall problems can be helped by Big Data
                                predictive analytics. France's Orange mobile
                                phone network launched a project called 'Data
                                for Development'. 2.5 billion phone and text
                                records were anonymised and analysed for people
                                in the Ivory coast. As a result, researchers
                                worked out where people went when they got ill
                                and how people reacted when there was a disease
                                outbreak. From this, resources in health care
                                can now be better targetted and more efficiently
                                used.

                                How is information extracted from huge, complex
                                data sets? The process of finding patterns and
                                predicting outcomes and trends is known as '
                                <strong>predictive analytics</strong>'.
                                Companies are constantly looking to better
                                understand the information buried in large and
                                complex data sets so that they can make better
                                business decisions. Predictive analytics is the
                                process of trying to extract knowledge from
                                data. This is no easy task! Going back to the
                                examples of social media companies for a moment,
                                we can see that the data being posted is highly
                                unstructured. Posts are in different languages,
                                using different conventions, with sound, video
                                and animations, using different formats and so
                                on. The complexity of data and finding ways of
                                bringing it together in a way that can be
                                investigated is just one of the challenges for
                                predictive analysts. Another challenge is the
                                sheer volume of data. How can it be made more
                                manageable? Can it be sampled and of so, how? Is
                                some data more important than others? All of
                                these questions comes under the remit of
                                predictive analytics.
