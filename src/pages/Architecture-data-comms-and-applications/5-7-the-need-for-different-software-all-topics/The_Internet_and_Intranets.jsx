                                of facilities as the Internet but&nbsp;they are
                                only available from within the organisation
                                itself and runs from a local server, so web

                                may be able to dial into an organisation's

                                This might be very useful, for example, for a
                                customer to get access to specialised technical
                                data or for a&nbsp;salesman to check
                                availability from a database kept on the
                                Intranet or for a company to advertise itself.

                                      think that we can all be fully trained
                                      doctors by just clicking on a web site.
