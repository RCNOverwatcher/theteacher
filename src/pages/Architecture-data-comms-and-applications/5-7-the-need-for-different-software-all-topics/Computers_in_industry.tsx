                                There are many jobs that didn't exist a few
                                years ago and in the future, there will be many
                                types of jobs that we can't predict today. This
                                is why it is very important for students to
                                learn to be adaptable, to be able to think for
                                themselves and to be able to change skills
                                easily. And it is also important for students to
                                read widely, as there are so many different
                                potential implications for the workplace with

                                People have more opportunity to work from home
                                now&nbsp;(called 'tele-working'). They can
                                organise their working life around their home
                                life, which might be important if someone has
                                children, is a carer for a relative or has a
                                disability. A range of computer equipment now
                                allows someone to do their job and stay in
                                contact with their employers. They might use a
                                computer and an Internet connection with a
                                tablet, a printer, a webcam and microphone, a
                                smartphone and a FAX, for example. If a company
                                is based in Australia, they no longer need to
                                look for employees just in that country for some
                                jobs - they can use tele-workers based anywhere
                                in the world, especially from countries where
                                the salary expectations are much lower. Equally,
                                an employee from a developing country has
                                opportunities for higher paid jobs in other
                                countries and doesn't even have to move
                                there!&nbsp;Many computer-based jobs, for
                                example, writing software, can be done from
                                anywhere in the world. India and Malaysia, for
                                example, has a pool of very highly-educated
                                English-speaking programmers that can be
                                employed at much cheaper rates than western
                                programmers.

                                Many mundane jobs have been replaced by
                                computer-controlled machinery. For example, some
                                welding jobs in car factories can now be done
                                with robots. The quality of the work is better.
                                The robots can be run for 24 hours a day with
                                only a limited amount of time down for
                                maintenance. They don't go on strike or need to
                                be paid (although the initial cost of the robots
                                is considerable).&nbsp;Robots, however, need
                                specialist skills. Someone has to design them,
                                build them, maintain them, program and
                                re-program them, for example. This has meant new
                                opportunities for workers willing to be trained
                                in newer technologies.&nbsp;

                                  One general pattern that has emerged over the
                                  years is that whilst jobs at the low-skill end
                                  of the job market come under pressure as a

                                Email has replaced a lot of communication that
                                was done on paper. Initially, people talked of a
                                'paperless society' but a healthy dose of
                                reality has set in. Many communications,
                                however, are now done electronically. Both
                                internal and external communications are
                                instant, relatively cost-free compared to the
                                post and have reduced the amount of paper
                                consumed, which is good for both the company and
                                the environment. Many text documents including
                                email are now also quickly and easily dictated
                                using voice recognistion software. The need for
                                secretaries has diminished in the last 10 years,
                                although the need for Personal Assistants (PAs)
                                with better skills has increased, and the jobs
                                are better paid, too!

                                Travelling to a meeting can cost a company a lot
                                of time and money, especially if the meeting is
                                abroad. Travel tickets have to be paid for,
                                hotels booked, cars rented, meals paid for and
                                then the person going to the meeting is often
                                not very productive as they travel to and from
                                meetings and recover from long flights. With the
                                advance of video conferencing, the reasons for
                                people to be out of the office for days while
                                they travel to meetings in distant parts has
                                been reduced. This has meant that they can be
                                doing more constructive things.&nbsp;

                                <br />
                                It costs a lot of money to support businesses
                                that are 'customer-facing' such as airlines
                                dealing with tickets, electricity, gas and water
                                companies, who have to deal with thousands of
                                customers daily, businesses like Amazon, Sky and
                                telephone companies, who also have to deal with
                                many customer contacts. These businesses are
                                always trying to drive down costs to get a
                                competitive advantage over their rivals. One way
                                of doing this is to use call centres based in
                                foreign parts where English is common. We have
                                already mentioned India and Malaysia but there
                                are other countries, too, such as South Africa,
                                which Amazon uses for call centre staff. This is
                                made possible because phone calls from your
                                phone can be re-routed instantly via the
                                Internet at negligible cost to a call centre
                                operative in a foreign land, where salaries and
                                running costs are a fraction of those in the UK
                                or USA. Not everyone likes this set-up, however!
                                Customers sometimes complain about not
                                understanding accents and there are cultural
                                differences between people that can lead to
                                misunderstandings, for example, words and
                                phrases used by one person in one country may
                                appear rude to a person in a different country.

                                attendance and behaviour. The software could,
                                for example, automatically contacts parents on
                                their mobile phones by SMS e.g. if a student
                                isn't registered so they know immediately their
                                child is missing lessons for some reason.

                                companies. The rise in recent years of cloud
                                computing as helped this. Cloud computing means
                                that documents are stored centrally 'on the
                                Internet' somewhere, usually by as third party,
                                who is paid to deal with backing-up data and
                                security issues as well as to provide space. At
                                the same time, workers have a copy of the
                                central document on their own local computer or
                                tablet PC. Workers on a project can share and
                                modify any document a team is working on and
                                those changes will automatically be synchronised
                                so that copies kept centrally and locally on
                                team members' computers are updated
                                automatically when the team member next logs
                                onto the Internet.

                                Supermarkets and other retail outlets make use
                                of a lot of computer technology as the market
                                place is very competitive - each supermarket
                                needs every edge it can get over its rivals!
                                Computers are used to control stock in
                                warehouses, to automatically order shelves to be
                                re-stocked and items to be re-ordered. Loyalty
                                card schemes track what people buy and can
                                personalise offers made to individuals based on
                                their past buying habits. Data mining techniques
                                (looking at huge quantities of data to find
                                meaningful and helpful patterns) are now used to
                                identify trends in buying, so that exactly the
                                right products can be in the right place on the
                                shelf at the right time in the right stores and
                                at the right price to maximise profits.
                                Communications around the store is now common.
                                You will often see employees walking around with
                                Bluetooth headsets on so that everyone is always
                                in touch and can be doing something
                                constructive. Computers keep track of fridges
                                and freezers, to ensure food is fresh. They look
                                after security, everything from CCTV and
                                face-recognition software to catch known
                                shoplifters, to anti-shoplifting equipment and
                                burglar alarms. The uses are really endless!

                                Anyone can set up an online business now very
                                easily. There are many stories of people setting
                                up a business using eBay, for example, and
                                making their fortune selling online. With the
                                right business model, products and price, anyone
                                can do it without any technical details of how
                                to get a web presence. Online businesses can be
                                a one-person business but appear as if they are
                                competing with much larger businesses. They can
                                sell across the world and 24/7 and all the main
                                functions like receiving orders, confirmations,
                                tracking receiving payments, providing support
                                and so on can all be done online and all be
                                automated. Of course, other people have made
                                their fortunes by buying a Domain Name and
                                domain space for a website and then setting up
                                an online shop using some free or paid-for
                                software and selling that way. The software for

                                up in a matter of minutes (reading up on how to
                                do it might take an hour, though!). A CMS is
                                simply a framework that allows you to drop
                                content (e.g. text, a picture, a video) into a

                                the business. Facebook is a CMS - you add
                                content and play with settings but you don't
                                actually design the layout yourself. Common CMSs

                                and not least those in Africa. It has been
                                traditionally very difficult to install fixed
                                line communications in countries that are

                                estimated that nearly 60% of Africans now own a
                                mobile phone and the percentage is increasing
                                all the time. Most still use 2G services for

                                weather involves collecting and then working on
                                huge amounts of sets of data. An array processor
                                is a type of processor that has a number of
                                Arithmetic and Control Units (ALUs). A control
                                unit can issue a single instruction to all of
                                the ALUs at the same time, and each ALU can then
                                work on its own set of data, independently of
                                the other ALUs. The result is that large amounts
                                of data can be processed very quickly. If you
                                have lots of sets of data that all have to be
                                processed in the same way, than this can be a
                                very fast way of carrying out processing. An
                                array processor is also known as a Single
