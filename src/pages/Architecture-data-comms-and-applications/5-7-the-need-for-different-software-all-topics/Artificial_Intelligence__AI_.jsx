                                  McCarthy came up with the term Aritificial
                                  Intelligence in 1955 and defined it as, "the
                                  science and engineering of making intelligent
                                  machines". The BCS defines it as, "the study

                                  intelligence of all forms and modelling them

                                  better at what they do. Alan Turing (of
                                  Bletchley Park and Enigma fame) was very
                                  interested in AI and invented the Turing test,
                                  to evaluate whether a machine could
                                  convincingly mimic the intelligent behaviour
                                  of people. You can read about the Turing test

                                This area of AI looks at the interaction between
                                computers and people using their voice and
                                working towards getting computers to
                                'understand' what a person wants. The programs
                                that aim to do this often use something called
                                'machine learning'. This means that instead of
                                trying to work out what the maths rules (the
                                algorithms) are that describe something, a large
                                block of data is used to try and build an
                                algorithm that describes something and then that
                                algorithm is used to make predictions and
                                decisions. Based on the results and outputs of
                                the predictions, the algorithm is revisited, fed
                                the new data, improved and then are used to make
                                more predictions and decisions. This results in
                                more output data, which can be fed back into the
                                'improving the algorithm' cycle in an iterative
