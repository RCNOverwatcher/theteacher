                                look at? What sort of things do you hope to be
                                able to do. Identify in general terms some
                                things that can't be done now, either that the
                                customer wishes they could do but there isn't
                                time, or some things that might be useful but
                                would create a project that is too large to
                                complete in the time available. Don't be too
                                specific at this point - you haven't
                                investigated the problem area in detail yet so
                                you don't want to be writing too much about it.

                                &nbsp;A limitation is simply something that your
                                system can't do, that if it could, it would be

                                the problem area in any detail yet, it will be
                                difficult to know the limitations of any

                                use feedback to refine your understanding of the
                                problem and the proposed solution. Although you
                                haven't investigated the problem fully yet or
                                come up with a solution, you should have talked
                                to your user about the problem area and should
                                discussed general ideas about a solution. You
                                could provide evidence of refining your
                                understanding of the problem and your outline
                                approach by producing a diagram of the problem,
                                perhaps on an A3 sheet. In very broad, general
                                terms, you could on one sheet draw boxes to
                                represent different screens, add a few details
                                to describe each box, show how they are linked,
                                explain what they do and anything else that you
                                know. Use colour, stickmen, cut out pictures,
                                draw arrows and anything else you know up to
                                this point. In other words, you can draw a
                                non-technical 'rich picture' that you can then
                                take back to your user to discuss and to check
                                you have fully understood correctly what they
                                have already told you. Take note of their
                                comments and then include the very first
                                interview with your user, the rich picture and
                                the subsequent comments as the evidence for this
                                section.

                                <strong>x)</strong> Remember, you haven't
                                investigate the problem fully yet and don't know
                                fully what the requirements are. You only know
                                what the problem area is and may have an idea
                                about how you will go about solving the problem.
                                This means that you must not go into too much
                                detail in Section 1.&nbsp;
