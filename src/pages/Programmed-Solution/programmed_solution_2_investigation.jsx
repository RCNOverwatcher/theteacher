                                solved. You are being asked to investigate the
                                current system using a variety of appropriate
                                methods so you must use at least two methods.

                                one in-depth interview, to find out what it is
                                your user wants, in addition to the ones you
                                have already done. You will need to identify
                                what the product will look like when it is
                                finished, what features it will have, what
                                functions it can perform, how it will be used,
                                who will use it, where any data it needs will
                                come from, what validation rules each piece of
                                data might need, what input and output might be
                                necessary, what any screens will look like, what
                                security arrangements (log-ins and passwords,
                                for example) need to exist, what back-up
                                arrangements need to be in place and so
                                on.&nbsp;Plan the interview questions in

                                If you are building on a system that already
                                exisits, or using data from existing sources,
                                can you collect any existing documents and get
                                examples of any records or data that your
                                solution will use? You can ask for examples at
                                the in-depth interview. These will help you
                                start to work out what data your system needs to
                                use, its nature, data type, special cases,
                                validation rules and examples.

                                Are you producing a game or other system? You
                                could ask a small sample of the target users to
                                complete a questionnaire, to find out the kind
                                of features they like and dislike.
                                <br />

                                similar problems and see how they were solved?
                                For example, can you find a game with some input
                                and output and see how they handled that? If you
                                are writing an adventure or dungeons and dragons
                                game, can you find the code for a working game
                                and have a look at it? How did they store
                                characters? how did they keep track of each
                                character's attributes? How did they actually
                                get two characters to 'fight'. You can learn a
                                lot by looking at existing similar problems and
                                solutions.

                                of the entities you've identified, describe them
                                briefly. What is their job, their role and their
                                interest in whatever solution you
                                provide?&nbsp;Can you say why each stakeholder
                                might be interested in any solution you provide?
                                What benefit is it to them? What will they be
                                able to do when they have your solution that

                                You may need to do and write up interviews with
                                the different kinds of stakeholders, or do
                                questionnaires.&nbsp;You could quickly provide

                                  user. You then go back to your user and get
                                  further information to clarify points. You
                                  them produce a 'Final Requirements
                                  Specification'. You then go back to your user
                                  to check it. If they are happy, both you and
                                  they sign and date a copy of the final User
                                  Requirements Specification on headed paper
