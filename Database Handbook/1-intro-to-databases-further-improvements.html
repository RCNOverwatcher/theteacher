                            ><br />We have solved some problems by splitting the
                            original flat file into two related tables. We
                            haven't solved all the problems, however. We still
                            have to record breed details over and over again and
                            we can't record a new breed in our database unless
                            there is a real dog of that breed actually owned by
                            someone! We could try splitting up the dogs’ table
                            into two, like this:

                            <strong>Summary</strong><br />What we have seen is
                            that flat files have their uses for small databases.
                            As the number of records in a flat file increases,
                            however, jobs that used to be simple and quick start
                            taking a lot longer. There comes a time when it is
                            much better to consider breaking up one big file to
                            produce smaller tables that are related. These types
                            of databases are known as ‘relational databases’. A
                            useful technique to help the designer achieve this
                            is Entity-Relationship modelling. We talk about
                            producing an E-R diagram for a particular database.
                            E-R diagrams show a database designer what tables
                            they need in a particular database and how those
                            tables are related to each other. E-R diagrams do
                            not in themselves show the designer what fields need
                            to go in each table. (The designer will produce
                            another document - a Data Dictionary - to record
                            this information.) As with any new computerised
                            system, an organisation needs to think carefully
                            before it goes ahead and installs a computerised
                            database.
