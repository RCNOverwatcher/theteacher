                            ><br />The NoKats dog club, formed in 1973,
                            currently keeps a record of its members and the dogs
                            they own on little index cards (an example of which
                            is shown below). The cards are kept together by the
                            secretary and can be used for reference, e.g. to
                            inform members of a show. This was an excellent
                            system for the first few decades of the dog club
                            when membership was around 100. In the last few
                            years, however, membership has grown to over 5000.
                            This is proving a real headache for the secretary.

                                  It takes a long time to find an individual
                                  member’s record because there are now over
                                  5000 of them. This is especially true if you
                                  search using multiple search criteria.

                                <li>
                                  It takes even longer to find a dog’s record,
                                  especially if a member’s details aren’t known
                                  for some reason.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Finding all dogs who meet certain criteria,
                                  e.g. all poodles born after a certain date
                                  takes a long time manually.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Occasionally, all of the records need to be
                                  sorted into a different order. This can take a
                                  long time.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  When records are filled in, some details are
                                  recorded over and over again. For example, a
                                  spaniel, its origins and its life expectancy
                                  are recorded in a number of different records.
                                  This is clearly a waste of the secretary’s
                                  time. It would be far better if the details
                                  for each breed could be stored just once.

                                  Details for personalised letters and address
                                  labels have to be manually transferred over to
                                  the letters and labels from the index cards.
                                  This is another time-consuming job.

                                  entered onto the cards.

                                  information held in a record. In this case,

                                  Surname, Breed, Origin of breed and so on.

                            A simple flat file database has been created. A
                            ‘flat file’ means that all the records are held in
                            one table. Each row in the table corresponds to one
                            record. Each column in the table corresponds to a
                            different field. Tables are two-dimensional
                            structures. They are therefore also referred to as
                            ‘flat’, hence the name ‘flat file’. Here are some
                            sample records for dogs in the NoKats Dog Club.
