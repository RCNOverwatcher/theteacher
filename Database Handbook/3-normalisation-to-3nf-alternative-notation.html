                            An alternative notation

                            <strong>Introduction</strong><br />It is quite
                            common in textbooks to see tables laid out not in a
                            table form but using some ‘notation’. For example,
                            the Member table in the ‘DVD Now’ example at the
                            beginning of this section had a Primary Key called
                            MemID, and then the attributes Surname, Add1, Add2,
                            Phone and Join.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <strong>Using the alternative notation</strong
                            ><br />This would be represented using this notation
                            as:
                          </p>
                          <p style="margin-left: 30px">

                            Also in the ‘DVD Now’ example, we had these tables:
                          </p>
                          <p style="margin-left: 30px">

                          </p>
                          <p>Note the following things with this notation.</p>
                          <ol>
                            <li style="list-style-type: none">
                              <ol>
                                <li>The table name is in capital letters.</li>
                                <li>
                                  The primary key is underlined. If a table has
                                  a compound primary key (one that is made up of
                                  more than one attribute) then all the
                                  attributes used to make up that key are
                                  underlined (as in the MEMBER_DVD table).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  The attributes in each table are listed after
                                  the primary key.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  If an attribute is a foreign key (used to link
                                  two tables together) then it has a star put
                                  next to it in the table where it is a foreign
                                  key. An example of this can be seen in the DVD
                                  table where Cert has a star next to it. In
                                  that table, it is a foreign key. In the
                                  CERTIFICATE table, however, Cert is a primary
                                  key.
                                </li>
                              </ol>
                            </li>
                          </ol>
                          <p>
                            Some students find this notation easy to work with
                            after a little practice. Others find it easier to
                            work with the Analysis Table because it presents a
                            visual representation of the table design. Whichever
                            method you prefer, it is straightforward converting
                            from one method to the other.

                            normalisation. We know that it is a methodical

                                  To go from UNF to 1NF, we put repeating
                                  attributes into their own groups.
                                </li>

                                  To go from 1NF to 2NF, we put non-key
                                  attributes that depend upon only part of
                                  compound primary keys into their own groups.

                                  To go from 2NF to 3NF, we put non-key
                                  attributes that depend upon other non-key
                                  attributes into their own groups.

                            We know that the most difficult stage is usually
                            going from 1NF to 2NF. We know that we can have
                            tables that are made up only of a compound primary
                            key. We know that there is an alternative way of
                            carrying out the normalisation process. This
                            involves using a notation. We know that we must be
                            able to use this notation as well as Analysis
                            Tables.
