                            <strong>TASK 1.</strong> The aims of normalisation
                            are to get rid of adding, deleting and amending
                            anomolies (that lead to data inconsistencies) and to
                            remove data redundancy.

                                  of each customer once. Each customer, however,
                                  can have many accounts, so we move the details
                                  we will record about each account into its own
                                  group.

                                  1NF to 2NF - AccountNumber, AccountType,
                                  Description and Balance do not depend on the
                                  Cust-ID. These attributes are therefore moved
                                  into their own group and a Primary Key is
                                  selected for it, in this case, AccountNumber
                                  is the most obvious choice. Note that we have
                                  a group with a compound primary key but no
                                  non-key attributes. This is not a problem!

                                  2NF to 3NF - We are checking to see if any
                                  non-key attributes clearly depend upon any
                                  other non-key attributes. AccountDescription
                                  is dependent on the type of account. Therefore
                                  we move this non-key attribute into its own
                                  group along with the non-key attribute it is
                                  dependent upon. We make AccountType the
                                  primary key in the new group because it is the
                                  non-key attibute that the other non-key
                                  attribute depends upon. Note also that this
                                  primary key is not a number but a word. This
                                  is fine, so long as all values of the primary
                                  key in that table are unique, which they will
                                  be (Gold, Platimum, Silver). We then signal
                                  that AccountType is a foreign key in the old
                                  group by putting a star next to it.

                                  can take many modules, so we move the details
                                  we will record about each module into its own
                                  group.

                                  LecturerSurname and LecturerInitial do not
                                  depend on StudentID. These attributes are
                                  therefore moved into their own group. We are
                                  left with a table with only a compound primary
                                  key and no non-key attributes. This is not a
                                  problem! We also need to select a primary key
                                  for the the new group. We can pick
                                  CourseNumber.

                                  other non-key attributes. LecturerSurname and
                                  LecturerInitial are both dependent on a
                                  Lecturer’s ID. Therefore we move these non-key
                                  attributes into their own group. We make
                                  LecturerID the primary key in the new group.
                                  We then signal that LecturerID is a foreign

                                  and we can identify the part number as a

                            a. Each Brownie’s personal details are unnecessarily
                            duplicated. A Brownie’s details will be recorded in
                            both the Brownie’s file and the Badge file. In
                            addition, each Brownie’s details might be recorded
                            more than once in the Badge file for each badge they
                            collect. Apart from data redundancy, the same
                            Brownie’s details might be incorrectly entered in
                            one record, leading to data inconsistency. Another
                            example where this might happen, is in the
                            description of each badge. The description will have
                            to be entered into the Badge file over and over
                            again (data redundancy) and has the potential to be
                            incorrectly entered differently in one or more
                            records, resulting in data inconsistency.
