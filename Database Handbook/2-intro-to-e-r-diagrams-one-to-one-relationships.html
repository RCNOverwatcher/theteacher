                            relationship is shown with a simple straight line.
                            An example of this kind of relationship is shown
                            below:

                              ><strong>Using one-to-one relationships</strong
                              ><br />This kind of relationship is used to keep
                              the database design compact and clear. For
                              example, suppose you had a PRODUCT table for all
                              products sold by a supermarket. Some of those
                              products are CDs and some are, for example, fish!
                              If you are keeping information (attributes) about
                              the products, one possible set of attributes for
                              the PRODUCT table might be the following:</span
                            >
                          </p>
                          <p style="text-align: center">
                            <span style="line-height: 1.5"
                              ><img
                                src="images/320eab57-ac5b-4392-8ab1-b2922a69dccber15.JPG"
                                alt="er15"
                            /></span>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <span style="line-height: 1.5"
                              >Of course, the number of attributes needed could
                              be very large. This is because ‘products’ in a
                              supermarket aren’t restricted just to CDs and
                              fish. They will include items such as clothes,
                              insurance, cars, fresh vegetables and so on. Each
                              of these products will need their own specialist
                              attributes. For example, you might need an
                              attribute to hold the size of clothes. Clearly, as
                              you fill out this table with records of each
                              actual product, some of these attributes will be
                              left blank. For example, if you entered the
                              details for ABBA's greatest hits, the 'Fresh /
                              frozen' attribute will need to be left blank! So
                              not only will you have a table with a great many
                              different attributes, many of them for a
                              particular product will be left blank. This is not
                              the clearest of designs! It would be better to
                              split up the PRODUCT table into logical entities.
                              One entity would be purely for CDs. One would be
                              purely for fish. Another would be for clothes, and
                              so on.</span

                            Now you can keep the common product information in
                            the PRODUCT table (like ID, Name, Price etc).
                            However,

                            any specific information relating to a particular
                            product type would go in that product’s table. For
                            example, if you have an ABBA CD for sale, the ID
                            code, Name and Price would go in the Product table.
                            There would be one entry in the CD_INFO table, where
                            you would put the CD length, year of recording and
                            artist. The result of using one-to-one relationships
                            in a database is a clearer design.

                            help someone understand the diagram. Note that some
                            CDs might be compilations of many groups’ songs, and
                            some tracks might appear on more than one CD. For
                            example, a track might appear on a compilation CD
                            and a greatest hits CD as well as the original CD it
                            was released on.
