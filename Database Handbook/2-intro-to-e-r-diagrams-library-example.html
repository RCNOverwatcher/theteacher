<h1 style="text-align: center;">A library database example</h1>
<p><strong>Introduction<br></strong>Now you know how to interpret E-R diagrams, you can practice putting them together from the start. You would begin by investigating whatever system you have been asked to design a database for. You could do this (amongst other methods) by:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Interviewing people individually.</li>
<li>Carrying out group interviews.</li>
<li>Collecting example documents.</li>
<li>Observing people using the system.</li>
<li>Producing questionnaires.</li>
<li>Sending out questions by email, fax or post.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The next step would be to write down how the system works.</p>
<p><strong>A library database example</strong><br>A library contains books! Pupils take out up to six books from the library. There may be more than one copy of a particular book. Books are usually written by only one author but sometimes they are written jointly, by more than one author.</p>
<p>This is a typical description of part of a library database. The entities in this particular system, the ‘objects’ about which we will keep details might be identified in a first attempt as BOOK, COPY_OF_BOOK, PUPIL and AUTHOR. We know that:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;"> 
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Each pupil can take out many different copies of books.</li>
<li>Each copy of each book can only be taken out by one pupil at a time.</li>
<li>Each book may have many copies.</li>
<li>Each copy of each book can only be about one particular book.</li>
<li>Each book can be written by many authors.</li>
<li>Each author can write many books.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Drawing a first attempt for the E-R diagram gives us</p>

<p><strong>TASK 6</strong> &nbsp;Add helping words and phrases to the above E-R diagram to aid understanding.</p>
<p><strong>TASK 7</strong>&nbsp; Now redraw the E-R diagram, resolving the many-to-many relationship.</p>
