<h1 style="text-align: center;">Resolving many-to-many relationships</h1>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>Taking a many-many relationship between two tables, which we cannot use, and redesigning it into a form we can use is known as 'resolving a many-to-many relationship'. If you have a many-to-many relationship, you can turn it into two one-to-many relationships by creating an extra linking table.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="images/a0b0251f-5941-4783-b021-b41d33d7b498er10.JPG" alt="er10"></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">If the primary key of an entity A is attribute X and the primary key of entity B is attribute Y, then the primary key of the extra table is a ‘compound primary key’ made up of X and Y.</span></p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>A <strong>simple</strong> primary key is a primary key that is made up of only one attribute.</li>
<li>A <strong>compound</strong> primary key is a primary key that is made up of more than one attribute.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>An example of ‘resolving a many-to-many relationship’</strong></p>
 
<p><br>Looking at some sample records for the Pupil-GCSE many-to-many relationship problem, we can see the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/421e00db-2541-4013-8e8d-151bd6d6aa65er11.JPG" alt="er11"><br>Reading the relationships, we have:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Each record in the Pupil table (i.e. each actual pupil) has many entries in the Pupil_GCSE table. Have a look at pupil number one. She has three entries in the Pupil_GCSE table because she does three GCSEs.</li>
<li>Each record in the Pupil_GCSE table (each row) relates to only one record (one pupil) in the Pupil table. Look, for example, at the last record in the Pupil_GCSE table (Pup_ID = 2 and GCSE_ID = 4). This record is related to only one record in the Pupil table. This particular record relates only to pupil number 2.</li>
<li>Each GCSE appears in many different records (rows) in the Pupil_GCSE table. Look, for example, at the ICT GCSE. This GCSE appears twice in the Pupil_GCSE table. It appears in the second record and in the last one.</li>
<li>Each record in the Pupil_GCSE table relates to just one GCSE. Look, for example, at the third record in the Pupil_GCSE table. (Pup_ID = 1 and GCSE_ID = 5). This record is related to only one record (one GCSE) in the GCSE table. It is related to GCSE number five, D&amp;T.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have resolved our many-to-many relationship. We store each pupil’s details only once. This is good! We store the details about each GCSE only once. This is also good! We have a third table that matches up each pupil to every GCSE they are taking. This table has a compound primary key made up of the primary key from the pupil table and the primary key from the GCSE table. Each compound primary key combination is unique! (Each row is unique - you cannot have two rows the same). At any time, we can recombine the data from any related records from the three tables into one record!</p>
<p><strong>TASK 4</strong> &nbsp;A music CD can contain many tracks. A track can appear on many different CDs (for example, on a compilation CD, a greatest hits CD etc).</p>
<p>a) Complete the drawing of the E-R diagram of the many-to-many relationship. (Don’t forget the helping words!)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="images/ec698f45-272c-4e5c-aae2-48f6f48c8758er19.JPG" alt="er19"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">b) Resolve the many-to-many relationship into two one-to-many relationships. Draw the final E-R diagram design. Clearly indicate a suitable primary key for each of the entities.&nbsp;</p>
