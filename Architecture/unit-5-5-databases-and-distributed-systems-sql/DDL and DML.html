<h1 style="text-align: center;">DDL and DML</h1>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong class="NormalContentHeading">Introduction<br></strong><span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">Broadly speaking, there are two main functioning parts to a DBMS. These are the DDL and the DML.</span></p>
 
<p class="NormalContent"><strong class="NormalContentHeading" style="line-height: 1.5;">Data Definition Language (DDL)<br></strong>The Data Definition Language (DDL) is one part of the DBMS. It is used by the designer of a database rather than a user. The DDL is used to set up the structure of a database as well as for maintaining the database. For example, using the DDL, they can set up tables of data about data (names of attributes, data types, validation rules etc). The data about data is often called ‘meta-data’. The DDL is also used to set up the security systems in the database. This is done using the DDL by describing the whole database (the ‘schema’) and then describing data in <em>parts</em> of the database (the ‘sub-schema’). Once this has been done, the designer can control access to each of the sub-schema. For example, if a receptionist needs to know each employee’s department, extension and job title, then a sub-schema will be defined with these data items in it. The receptionist is then given access to that sub-schema (she is allowed to view that data on her screen) but not other sub-schema. That means she cannot, for example, access how much an employee earns, or the contents of their personnel file. Using the DDL, then, different users of a database can be allowed to access certain sub-schema but not others.&nbsp; Users can be given different ‘views’ of the same data in a database.</p>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong class="NormalContentHeading">Data Manipulation Language (DML)</strong><br> The DML is another important part of the DBMS. It is commonly used by the users of a database to access and update data. This language allows users to actually work on the data in your database. They could, for example, write programs that add, delete, modify or retrieve data! The DML is a high level language. This ensures that minimal programming skills are necessary to actually use it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong>Structured Query Language (SQL)</strong><br>The industry standard for DDL and DML is called Structured Query Language, or SQL. We should get some experience using SQL.</p>
