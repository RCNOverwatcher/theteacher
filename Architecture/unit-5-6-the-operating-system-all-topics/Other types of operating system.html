<h1 style="text-align: center;">Other types of operating system</h1>
<p>We have already looked at batch processing and real time operating systems in some detail in previous sections. There are a few other types of classification of operating systems which should know about.</p>
 
<p><strong>Single-user operating system</strong><br>This kind of operating system is designed for one person to use at any one time. It is typically designed to be used in computer systems (such as Microsoft Windows, Mac OS and Linux), tablets and mobile phones (such as Windows Phone, Sailfish OS, Blackberry, Android and Firefox OS). These kinds of operating systems can often be set-up so that different users can use it, each with their own account, but only one user can use it at any one time.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-user operating system</strong><br>This is an operating system designed to be used by many people at the same time. It is typically found in networked systems and mainframes, where multiple users on computers or terminals can gain access to a single computer system with one operating system on it. The operating system has to monitor all of the jobs that each user wants, load up into its memory the necessary applications and manage the users accessing the applications. The different users on a multi-user operating system are accessing the same single operating system, as opposed to a set of computers on a network, each with their own operating system. There is a large cost saving for organisations using this kind of system, not least because older computers can still run very effectively on it. However, if the main computer goes down, it can have an impact on many different users and stop them working.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Multi-tasking operating systems</strong><br>These kinds of operating systems are able to 'multi-task'. That simply means that they can have open many applications and can allow the user to use them all at (apparently) the same time. It is 'apparently' because the CPU can only actually work on one application at a time, but it can switch so quickly between multiple applications that the user thinks that they are listening to music, writing an email, using their chat program and talking on Skye all at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-programming operating systems</strong><br>A computer that can&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">have open many applications and can allow the user to use them all at (apparently) the same time is also known as a 'multi-programming' system. Multi-programming environments open many different applications in memory and then cycle between them all to run them. Each application gets a small slice of the CPU's time before it is stopped. Then where it is up to is saved and then the next application is started from wherever it finished off last time, and is given a small slice of the CPU's time. All applications are given a slice of CPU time in this cycle and so the CPU is kept as busy as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;"><span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">There is a subtle difference between multi-programming and multi-tasking although they are often used interchangeably. Multi-tasking is a general term describing the user using and interacting with many applications at apparently the same time. It's all about the user interacting with those programs they are using. In multi-programming, we are not talking about the user interacting with the applications. This is purely the operating system making sure that the CPU is working as hard as possible on all jobs that have to be done by giving each job a slice of CPU time in a 'round-robin' cycle (or in another order determined by a different algorithm).</span></span></p>
