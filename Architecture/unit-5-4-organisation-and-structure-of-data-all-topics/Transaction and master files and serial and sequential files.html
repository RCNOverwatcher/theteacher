<h1 class="ContentHeading" style="text-align: center;" align="center">Transaction and master files and serial and sequential files</h1>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong> <span class="NormalContentHeading">Introduction</span></strong><span class="NormalContent"><br> Data is stored in files on storage devices, for example, on floppy disks, hard drives and magnetic tape. There is a choice of storage devices and there is also a choice in the way that files are organised on the storage device. Files can be organised so that a piece of data in the file can be accessed <strong>directly</strong>, without going through other pieces of data to get to it. This is a fast method of data access. Files could also be organised so that they are accessed <strong>serially</strong> or <strong>sequentially</strong>. This means that to find a file, you start at the beginning of the file and go through all the records in turn until you get to the one you want. This is a slow method of data access but has other benefits. When deciding what file organisation to use and what storage device to use, the key questions to ask are:</span></p>
 
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li class="NormalContent">How quickly do I need to get back a particular piece of data?</li>
<li class="NormalContent">What do I want to do with the data?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="NormalContent" align="center"><img src="images/99e50c6d-b9a2-48c2-8f80-efed74c3063ea.gif" alt="four ways"><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong class="NormalContentHeading">Serial files</strong><br> Data stored in a serial file is stored in <strong>time order</strong> only. When a new piece of data is added to the file, it is simply added on to the end of the file. If you had a serial file with 10000 items in it, they would be in the order that they were received on the storage device. This makes getting back any individual piece of data a rather slow process. The only way you can retrieve a particular record in a serial file is to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Check the file is not empty.</li>
<li>If it is empty, report 'Empty' and stop.</li>
<li>If it is not empty, start at the first record in the file</li>
<li>Check if it is the record you want.</li>
<li>If it is, report 'Record found' and stop.</li>
<li>If it is not, get the next record and repeat, until you either find the record you want or you get to the end of the file.</li>
<li>If you get to the end of the file, report 'File not found'.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="NormalContent">Data access with serial files is slow and is therefore not suitable for applications that require fast access to data. You wouldn't want to use this system of organisation, for example, for a driving licence database used to deal with customer enquiries. If a driver rang up DVLC (the driving licence centre) and wanted to query their details, it would take a very long time to search serially the whole database! Some applications, however, don't require fast access to data. Here are some examples.</p>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong class="NormalContentHeading">Back-ups</strong> <br> Most networks back-up the users' data onto magnetic tape during the night. The data will generally not be needed although occasionally a user will need to get back a copy of a file that they have accidentally deleted and very occasionally the whole network will need to be recovered after a system crash.</p>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong class="NormalContentHeading">A shop</strong><br> A shopkeeper might keep a record of each transaction made in the shop in time order (a serial file) over a 24-hour period. This file will hold details of each sale; what was sold and how many of each item. This file (also known as a ‘transaction file’) can then be used at the end of the 24-hour period to update the ‘master file’ of products. The master file is a record of the products and what is in stock. It doesn't change except when it is updated using the transaction file. Once updated, the stock control system can then be used to automatically re-order items.</p>
<p class="NormalContent">It is also worth noting that updating the master file using the transaction file is done using batch processing. In batch processing systems, all the data is collected together in one place (in the transaction file) before being processed. Once a transaction file has been used to update the master file, the transaction file can be cleared out. It will then be ready for a new transaction period. Master files are permanent. Transaction files exist only for the transaction period, and then they are cleared. It is also worth noting here that while a serial file can be used for this application, a more efficient way to process the transaction file would be to re-organise it into a sequential file first. This is discussed in the sequential file section later in this section.</p>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong class="NormalContentHeading">An Automatic Teller Machine (ATM)</strong><br> An ATM machine keeps a serial file of all the transactions made at the machine during a period of time, perhaps the last 24 hours - it keeps a 'transaction file'. Every time a user withdraws money, orders a new chequebook and so on, it is recorded in time-order. In the small hours of the night, however, the ATM will link to the bank's main computer and will batch process the transaction file to update the master file - everyone's bank details gets updated in one go. In addition, if there is a query from a customer about a transaction, then the serial file can be referred to for details of the transaction. <br> <br> <strong class="NormalContentHeading">A payroll system</strong><br> When a company's employees 'clock-on' or ‘clock off’, a record of this event is stored in a serial file set up for this purpose. The entry in the file will record the employee number and the time and date they clocked on or off. At the end of the week this serial file (take note that it is also known as a 'transaction file') is sorted into a sequential file - sorting the serial file into a sequential file would collect together each employee's entries, which are scattered throughout the serial file, and put them together and into the order that the employee records are stored on the master file, probably by employee number. The sequential file is then batch processed with the master file (the master file contains an up-to-date record of each employee, what their hourly rate is and a running total of their pay and deductions for the current tax year). The processing in this example means that the number of hours each employee has worked in total for the last week is calculated. The pay due is then worked out and the deductions (tax, NI, pension contributions and so on) made. Pay slips are printed out. The serial file is then cleared, ready for the next period of record collection.</p>
<p class="NormalContent" align="center"><img src="images/8398a713-3851-4d46-ac7a-a3f15de9b089b.gif" alt="master file update"><br>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p class="QuestionStyle"><strong class="NormalContentHeading" style="line-height: 1.5;">Sequential files<br></strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Serial files are organised by time. There are situations where this may not be the best way to organise data. Consider the above example involving a shopkeeper. Over a 24 hour period, the same products will be bought many times yet the details of each transaction involving the same product will be scattered throughout the serial file. When the serial file is processed, it will clearly need to return time after time to one product's details in the master file every time it comes across a transaction for that product. Having to constantly re-visit master file entries isn't very efficient! It would be better if the serial file, before the master file was updated, were processed to put all of the transactions for each of the products together. Not only that, however, it would be useful if the records were in the same order as the records in the master file. Then a product could be accessed once on the master file and all of the transactions that have taken place involving that product could be processed in one go. And since the sequential file and the master file records are in the same order, the records will be processed together in the most efficient way. You won’t get a record from the master file and then have to hunt through the sequential file.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="NormalContent">A file that is in some kind of order other than time order is known as a sequential file. In the above example, the master file might be a file of product details held in product ID order. We should therefore create a sequential file organised by product ID by processing the serial file, ensuring that all the product transactions for each product are together. We would then batch process the sequential file to update the master file.</p>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong class="NormalContentHeading">What media can be used for serial and sequential files?</strong><br> Both serial and sequential files are accessed by going to the beginning of the file, reading the first piece of data, then going to the next, and then the next and so on until the end of the file. Serial and sequential files can be stored on magnetic tape as well as media such as floppy disks, CD R/W and hard disks.</p>
