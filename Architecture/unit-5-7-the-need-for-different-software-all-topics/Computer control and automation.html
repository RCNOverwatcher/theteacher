<h1 style="text-align: center;">Computer control and automation</h1>
<p><strong>Introduction<br></strong>Computer control is the use of computer system to control a process. Typically, you start by telling the control system what you are aiming for, what you want the outputs to be. Then, input devices sensing the physical world take readings, or other systems collect data to use. This data is passed to the program to be processed using a program written for the purpose. The program will typically look at what you are trying to achieve, look at what the sensors or data is saying and where you are from where you want to be and then make decisions about what needs to happen. Outputs then occur. This could include everything from switching a light on, speeding up a motor, or displaying or updating some information on a screen. Once the system has been updated, the inputs are read again and the whole process is repeated.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Inputs</strong><br>Sensors are devices that respond to a specific physical property in a system. They are <strong><em>transducers</em></strong> in that they take one form of&nbsp;and convert it into another. Here are some examples.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">1) A thermistor is a temperature sensor (or temperature transducer). It converts a temperature into an analogue&nbsp;voltage. The voltage generated depends upon the temperature. There are an infinite number of temperatures and&nbsp;so there are an infinite number of voltages. Devices that generate an infinite range of values are known as&nbsp;'analogue' devices. You could use a thermistor in a chemical plant to read the temperature of a reaction. The&nbsp;processor could convert the data from the transducer into a graph. Operators could then see the history of the&nbsp;temperature of a reaction.<br>2) A photocell is a light sensor (light transducer). It converts light energy into an analogue voltage. Light meters use&nbsp;photocells. A photographer can set up a camera according to the light available, as indicated on a light meter.<br>3) A pressure sensor (pressure transducer) in a chemical reaction vessel converts pressure into an analogue signal.<br>4) A pressure mat in a burglar alarm is a sensor. It senses whether someone is either on the mat or off it. It has two&nbsp;possible states: on and off so it is known as a digital device.<br>5) A switch or push-button is a digital sensor. It detects one of two positions: on and off. Switches can be used to&nbsp;send signals to a system. For example, an operator in a factory might start a system by pressing the 'start' button.&nbsp;This signal is fed into the computer, which processes the signal in its program.<br>6) A proximity sensor is a digital sensor. When something gets too close to it, it generates a voltage. When there is&nbsp;nothing next to it, it generates no voltage. Proximity sensors, for example, can be used to signal to a lift control&nbsp;system that a particular floor is coming up. The program can then order the motor to slow down.</p>
<p><strong>Program</strong><br>The program will look at what you are trying to achieve, read the inputs, compare them, and then make decisions about what needs to happen to get you closer to where you want to be. Programs can be written in lots of different languages, although some are designed for specific purposes. For example, ADA is often used for safety-critical systems. Assmebly programming is often used for high-speed processing in factories.</p>
<p><strong>Outputs</strong><br>Outputs can be information on a screen but often, it involves turning things on or off or speeding things up or down, for example. Anything which is computer controlled which causes a movement to happen is said to be an <em><strong>actuator</strong></em>. Examples of actuators include motors, computer controlled valves and computer controlled pneumatic or hydraulic pistons. A light could be controlled by a computer system as well as a bell, for example, but they are not actuators because they don't cause movement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Interfaces</strong><br>sensors rarely just connect to a computer. Neither do output devices. More often than not, they use different physical plugs and sockets and produce or need signals which can't directly be understood by a computer. Therefore, sensors and output devices are usually connected to an <strong><em>interface</em></strong>.&nbsp;We can think of an interface as a black box, designed to have sensors and outputs physically connected to it, and designed to convert sensor signals into computer signals, and computer signals into signals that can control output devices.&nbsp;Looking at our previous diagram of a control system, we could modify it slightly to this:</p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/7ffef8a0-bcb7-4de2-bc86-a7cc2914867fauto2.GIF" alt="auto2"></p>
<p><strong>An automated control system</strong><br>A greenhouse could have a temperature control system or we could design a system to automatically control the temperature while a chemical reaction is taking place.</p>

<p>1) When the system is started, the desired temperature is&nbsp;inputted into the system, perhaps using a keypad.<br>2. A signal is sent to the heater and the tank heats up.<br>3. The thermistor (a temperature measuring sensor)&nbsp;constantly sends a signal back to the computer. This is&nbsp;known as a ‘feedback signal’ because it is used to compare&nbsp;the current temperature with a target one.<br>4. The process control program in the computer checks the&nbsp;current temperature against the desired temperature.<br>5. If the desired temperature hasn't been reached yet, the&nbsp;heater is kept on. This process is continued until the desired&nbsp;temperature is reached or exceeded.<br>6. When it is reached or exceeded, the heater is switched off.&nbsp;If the tank ever becomes too hot, then a pump (an actuator)&nbsp;is switched on. This pumps cool water around the tank.&nbsp;<br>7. It is switched off when the temperature returns to an&nbsp;acceptable level.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages of computer control systems and automation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Computer control systems can work 24 / 7 / 365 without a break and don't need paying.</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">Control systems don't need holidays, breaks or get ill.</span></li>
<li>Control systems can work to a much finer tolerance and accuracy than people.</li>
<li>Control systems work reliably all the time, without variation.</li>
<li>These systems can process information from thousands of different sensors and control lots of different outputs far faster than a person ever could.</li>
<li>They can be deployed in hazardous areas that humans couldn't go, or couldn't go for long periods of time e.g. at the bottom of the ocean, in deep space, in highly radioactive areas or on the top of mountains.</li>

<p><strong style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">Disadvantages of computer control systems and automation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Control systems are expensive to buy initially, although over time, money is saved.</li>
<li>Control systems need trained people to maintain them. This can be expensive.</li>
<li>Control systems do break down and do need maintenance.</li>
<li>If there is a bug in the program, something bad might happen!</li>
<li>Computer control systems will only follow the program. They don't get hunches that something isn't right and can't react to unforeseen circumstances, like people do.</li>
<li>There are some situations where people want people to be in charge e.g. driving a car or landing a plane.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></li>
