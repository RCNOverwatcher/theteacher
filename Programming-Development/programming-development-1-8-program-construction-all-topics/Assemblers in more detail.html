                            People write programs in programming languages!
                            There are many different languages, and many
                            different ways of classifying, or grouping together,
                            languages. You will have been learning a language on
                            the course. You might be learning Visual Basic, or
                            Pascal, or Java, for example. Below is an example of
                            a short Java program. Can you work out what it does?

                            Java, Visual Basic, Pascal and so on are examples of
                            a group of languages known as ‘high-level
                            languages’. These are languages that use ‘keywords’
                            in programs, words that are very close to English.
                            These types of languages also refer to memory
                            locations using variable names rather than their
                            actual addresses in RAM. For these reasons,
                            high-level languages are easier to learn than
                            low-level languages. They can also be more easily
                            ‘read’ and so are easier to debug. These kinds of
                            languages, because they are written using keywords,
                            must be changed (or ‘translated’) into a form that
                            the Central Processing Unit can understand (known as
                            ‘machine code’) before they can be run. A computer
                            does not ‘understand’ the word PRINT. It does,
                            however, know how to make the hardware print
                            something out if it receives the machine code
                            instruction for the keyword PRINT. The machine code
                            equivalent of PRINT might look like this: 00010101
                            00001001 01110010 11110101 01110010.

                            Low-level languages do not use keywords such as
                            'print', 'pause', 'if' 'while' and so on. They use
                            <strong>mnemonics</strong>. These are codes for
                            instructions, such as DEC (short for ‘decrement’) or
                            LD (short for ‘load’). Mnemonics are designed to be
                            easily remembered (hence the word 'mnemonic'). An
                            example of a short low-level program using mnemonics
                            is shown below.

                            Low-level languages are much closer to the workings
                            of a computer. Often, control programs that require
                            very fast execution speeds are written in a
                            low-level language, known as
                            <strong>assembly</strong>. This is because when they
                            are converted into machine code (using an
                            <strong>assembler</strong>), they produce less
                            machine code than if the equivalent program was
                            written in a high-level language. They therefore run
                            faster! There are also applications that require you
                            to manipulate a computer's hardware in a way that is
                            difficult to do with high-level languages. For
                            example, a programmer might use a low-level language
                            to write a print driver for a new printer and a
                            high-level language to write a sales program that
                            calculates salesmen's commissions.

                                  ‘machine-orientated languages’.

                            Low-level languages, while quite difficult to learn
                            compared to the newer high-level languages, are a
                            big improvement on what went on before. Programmers
                            had to write in the code that the computer could
                            actually work with and use! Below is an example of
                            part of a machine code program. Imagine writing
