<h1 style="text-align: center;">Lexical analysis</h1>
<p class="NormalContentHeading"><strong>The actions during lexical analysis</strong></p>
 <ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>The source code is looked at. Any unnecessary parts of it are removed. This would include comments and spaces.</li>
<li>Keywords and symbols are then replaced with ‘tokens’. A token is a generic description of the type of symbol. For example, if you had a constant called 'months_in_year', this would be replaced by the token CONSTANT. If you had variables called 'speed' and 'distance' then these would be replaced with the token VARIABLE. If you had a keyword 'IF', this would get replaced with the selection token for 'IF'. If you had a maths operator such as ‘&gt;’, this would get replaced with the token OPERATOR. By replacing symbols, variables, keywords and so on with generic tokens, you can turn a program into a set of 'patterns' of instructions. It is then a relatively easy job for the compiler in the syntax stage to check each pattern against the allowable ones. Tokens replace:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol><ol><ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"><ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>A keyword like IF, FOR, PRINT, THEN and so on.</li>
<li>A symbol that has got a fixed meaning, such as +, *.</li>
<li>Numeric constants.</li>
<li>User-defined variable names.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></ol>
<p>For example, if you had the following line in a program: <strong>IF x &gt; 10 THEN</strong> this might be changed into this pattern of tokens:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px;" align="center"><strong>SELECTION/IF-VARIABLE-OPERATOR-CONSTANT-SELECTION/THEN</strong></p>
<p>Notice that the spaces have been removed and generic descriptions (tokens) have replaced keywords, variables, symbols and numeric constants.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>A look-up table is created. This stores the values of all constants used along with their data type.</li>
<li>Variable names are also entered into the look-up table.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have lexically analysed your program, you end up with a string of tokens. This is passed to the syntax analysis stage.</p>
