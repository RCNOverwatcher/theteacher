<h1 style="text-align: center;">Keeping up-to-date</h1>
<p><strong class="NormalContentHeading">Keeping up-to-date</strong><br>Computer technology and the impact it has on our lives is ever-changing. It is therefore important that all students get into the habit of keeping up with these changes and reading widely. A student can learn facts and get a few ideas from websites such as ours, but they are no substitute for reading many articles about computing technology, different applications and the way we live changes as a result. This is not something that can be done at the last minute, a few weeks before exams! A students needs to get into the habit of reading three or four articles a week and making some notes about each of them. They should have a folder just for articles that have been read, printed off and notes made about so that when it come to exams, students should have many real examples to draw upon. There are some fabulous resources on the Internet <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/default.stm" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/" target="_blank">here</a>,&nbsp;for example.&nbsp;</p>
