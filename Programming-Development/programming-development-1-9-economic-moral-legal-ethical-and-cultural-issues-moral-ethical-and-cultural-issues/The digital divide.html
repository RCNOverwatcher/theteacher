<h1 style="text-align: center;">The digital divide</h1>
<p><strong class="NormalContentHeading" style="line-height: 1.5;">The digital divide<br></strong>The digital divide is the term used to describe some groups of people having access to computers, training on computers and computer-based information while other groups have limited access or none at all. For example:</p>
 
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Third world countries, already economically disadvantaged, are finding themselves at a further disadvantage because their citizens generally do not have the same opportunities as those in developed countries. Their citizens generally may not have the money to buy expensive computers and there may not be the same opportunity of education that you and I take for granted. The priority may simply be to find enough food for that day!</li>
<li>The digital divide can also refer to different groups of citizens within one country. Unemployed people, for example, may not be able to afford to buy computers, pay a subscription for Internet access or have the skills or confidence to get themselves on computer-related training courses.</li>
<li>Another group of people who may find themselves disadvantaged are pensioners. Their opportunity to access modern technology may be limited by their income, their background and the perception that computers are for younger people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many examples of organisations trying to reduce the effect of the digital divide. Schemes exist to give people better opportunities of access. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Pensioners and other groups are having training plans designed especially for them and delivered at local schools and colleges.</li>
<li>Subsidised or free access is in place in many libraries.</li>
<li>Recycled computers are given to disadvantaged groups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong class="NormalContentHeading">The digital divide in a small community</strong><br> Many village facilities have closed because they are uneconomical. These have included post offices, banks and village shops. This has had a big effect on people in villages. These facilities often provided a social life, a community spirit, a place to meet and jobs for the local community.</p>
<p>Many people have complained about the effects of closing facilities. Bus services were often poor and some groups of people felt isolated, especially if they didn't run a car. Some of the complaints, however, have been reduced as a result of the Internet. This is because the Internet has started to change the way that people live their lives. Many people now have Internet bank accounts. They don't need a traditional bank anymore because they can apply online for a mortgage or loan, transfer money, view statements, deal with questions and problems, for example. Supermarkets are slowly expanding their home delivery services nationwide. It is now possible to shop online and have an order delivered to your house. People are increasingly using email to send letters. They are increasingly using the Internet to socialise, using chat rooms with voice and web cam facilities. The patterns of people's lives have changed because of new technology.</p>
<p><strong>The digital divide in UK schools</strong><br>There are growing concerns in the UK that some areas of the country are being disadvantaged because of poor Internet connectivity. This is despite the fact that the UK has moved into the top 10 for connectivity, according to the <a href="http://www.broadbandcommission.org/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">UN's Broadband Commision's latest report</a>. According to a report by the&nbsp;British Educational Suppliers Association in 2014:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>half of pupils in UK state schools have slow broadband or unreliable wi-fi</li>
<li>65% of primary schools and 54% of secondary schools complained about poor or non-existent of WiFi connectivity</li>
<li>nearly half of primary schools and a third of secondary schools said they had inadequate broadband.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is especially a concern in large rural areas, including Cumbria, East Ayrshire and Gwynedd. Pupils who attend a school where the Internet is a problem are being put at a serious disadvantage compared to pupils in other areas.</p>
<p><strong>The digital divide and poverty in the UK</strong><br>According to Helen Milner, the CEO of <a href="http://www.tinderfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Tinder,&nbsp;a not-for-profit, staff-owned company</a>&nbsp;that is working to bridge the digital divide in Britain,&nbsp;"eleven million people across the UK are struggling to connect to the internet. Not because of problems with hardware, bad connectivity, or even rural broadband challenges, but because they either donâ€™t know how or are too poor to get online.&nbsp;A large proportion of those 11 million people live in the most deprived areas of the UK, and while the government is pushing for more public services to be digitised and placed online, this particular cross section of the country does not even have the basic means to access the internet, never mind using online public services."</p>
<p>The digital divide doesn't just exist between rich and poor countries. It can exist between different communities or socio-economic groups in the same country. Fortunately, organisations like Tinder exist to help promote the use of digital technology to include all sections of society.&nbsp;</p>
