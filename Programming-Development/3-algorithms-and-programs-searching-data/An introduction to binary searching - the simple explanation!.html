                            An introduction to binary searching - the simple
                            explanation!
                          </h1>
                          <p>
                            Binary searching is a very efficient way of
                            searching through lots of data items to find the
                            found you want. In serial searching, the data
                            doesn't have to be organised in any particular way.
                            We just start at the beginning and start looking
                            through the data one-by-one. If you are going to use
                            binary searching, the data must be sorted into an
                            order first or it just won't work. We can use one of
                            the sorting algorithms we have studied to do this or
                            another one, but the data must be sorted first.
