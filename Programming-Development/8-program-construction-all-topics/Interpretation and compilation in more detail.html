                            Programmers write programs in source code. This
                            might be using BASIC or Pascal or C++ or Visual
                            Basic, for example. However, this code cannot be
                            executed directly on a computer. First, the source
                            code must be translated into a form that the
                            computer can understand. This can be done using
                            interpreters and compilers.

                            ><br />
                            This type of translator takes the whole source code
                            and compiles it into object code. The object code
                            (sometimes called machine code) can then be run.
                            Pascal is an example of a programming language that
                            uses compilation. An Interpreter on the other hand
                            takes the source code and translates the first line
                            of the program and then executes it. It then does
                            the second line, and the third line, until it gets
                            to the end of the code. BASIC, LISP, PROLOG and APL
                            are programming languages that use interpretation.

                                  Compilation is much faster than
                                  interpretation. Once the compilation process
                                  has been completed, the object code will run
                                  faster than the same interpreted code. And you
                                  only have to compile the code once.

                                <li>
                                  Object code does not need the compiler to
                                  actually run it, only to convert it from
                                  source code to object code. Therefore, the
                                  object code produced by a compiler can be
                                  distributed to other computers without the
                                  compiler. You could write a program and then
                                  sell the object code on CD to anyone who wants
                                  to run the application.

                                  Object code is difficult to 'read' so that it
                                  can be distributed without actually revealing
                                  the code. This helps protect your intellectual
                                  rights.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Source code can be compiled in sections to
                                  produce object code in sections. You can't do
                                  this with interpreters. If you have a lack of
                                  free space in RAM, compilation may be more
                                  useful.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  If there is an error in interpretation, the
                                  program will run successfully up to the point
                                  where the error occurs. Then it will stop. All
                                  of the variables are available for inspection
                                  at that point. Once the error has been
                                  corrected, the program doesn’t need to be
                                  recompiled - it’s just run again using the
                                  interpreter. Because of this, debugging and
                                  program development are easier and quicker
                                  using interpretation compared to compilation.

                                  Interpreters are far simpler to write than
                                  compilers. This is why JAVA works - because it
                                  is a relatively easy job to write an
                                  interpreter for a particular computer or
                                  application compared to writing a compiler for
                                  the machine.

                            ><br />
                            A translator's job is to turn source code into
                            object code. It must be able to translate good code
                            that follows all the rules of the programming
                            language as well as signal problems with bad code.
                            There are three distinct steps to producing object
                            code:&nbsp; lexical analysis, syntactic analysis and
                            code generation.

                            During the lexical and syntactical analysis stages,
                            any code that cannot be analysed will be passed to
                            the error analyser software routine. If errors are
                            found, the report generator will display error
                            messages and object code will not be produced. If
                            the code produced by the lexical and syntactical
                            analysis stages produce no errors, then the object
                            code is generated and the report generator will say
                            as much. It will report on other details, such as
                            how much space the object code takes up in memory.
