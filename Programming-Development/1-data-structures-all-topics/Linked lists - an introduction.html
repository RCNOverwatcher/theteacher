                            >A linked list is an example of a data structure, a
                            structure that a programmer sets up in code. Once
                            set up, the programmer can then add data to it,
                            search for data in it and find data in it to amend
                            or delete. Linked lists are dynamic data structures
                            - they shrink and grow, depending on how much data
                            needs to be stored. They can be an almost unlimited
                            size, although they are often set up inside an
                            array, which is in some programming languages a
                            fixed size.

                            <strong>How linked lists work<br /></strong>A
                            programmer wants to store a list of fish
                            alphabetically in a linked list data structure. We
                            want to store Carp, Perch, Roach and Shark. Below is
                            an illustration of how the computer works with a
                            linked list.&nbsp;The programmer will initialise the
                            data structure in the program (in pseudo-code below)
                            but they will have no idea what actual memory
                            locations are selected by the computer when the
                            program is translated. For illustration purposes,
                            however, we will&nbsp;select a range of memory
                            addresses. We will select a range of memory
                            addresses only to illustrate that, in a linked list,
                            the&nbsp;individual pieces of data can be all over
                            the available RAM!
                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type: none">
                              <ul>
                                <li>
                                  The computer will store the beginning of the
                                  list in an area of RAM we will call the Head
                                  of Lists.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  We will call the memory location that holds
                                  where to find the first piece of data the
                                  START(FISH).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  If the computer looks at the contents of the
                                  START memory location, it will show it the
                                  memory location of&nbsp;the first node. A node
                                  is a piece of data plus the address of the
                                  next node. Itâ€™s memory location 2300!
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  The computer can then go to memory location
                                  2300, and it will find the data item Carp!
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Not only that, however. It will also find the
                                  memory location of the next piece of data,
                                  400.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  If the computer goes to memory location 400,
                                  it will find the next node; it will get the
                                  next piece of data,&nbsp;Perch, as well as the
                                  memory location of the next piece of data,
                                  9930, and so on.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  At some point the computer will get to the end
                                  of the list. When it gets to the last piece of
                                  data, the pointer&nbsp;at that node is given a
                                  null value - it is given a value that is not a
                                  valid memory address e.g. XXX
                                </li>

                            4 things:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1) The head
                            of the list. (This points to the first node).<br />&nbsp;
                            &nbsp; &nbsp;2) Pointers to nodes. (They either
                            point at the next place to look for a node or
                            contain a null value).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3)
                            Nodes (A node is a memory location that contains a
                            piece of data and another memory location).<br />&nbsp;
                            &nbsp; &nbsp;4) A null pointer. (This indicates the
                            end of the list. We have used XXX).

                          <p>
                            Note also that linked lists can make use of any
                            spare memory addresses going. If, for example, the
                            computer had two&nbsp;applications running in RAM,
                            separated by a couple of empty RAM addresses, it
                            could make use of that little bit of memory in
                            a&nbsp;linked list. The memory addresses don't have
                            to be next to each other. Linked lists can help a
                            computer ensure that memory is used wisely!

                            ><br />When you store sets of data, whether the data
                            structure is an array, a linked list or any other
                            structure, there will be times when&nbsp;you need to
                            do things with it! For example, you might want to:

                          <ul>

                            It would be useful to write algorithms to describe
                            how we could do the above. We know that an algorithm
                            is simply&nbsp;a set of step-by-step instructions
                            that describe how to do a particular task.
                            Algorithms can be written in semi-English,
                            or&nbsp;pseudo-code! When writing algorithms, you
                            should first concentrate on getting the logic
                            correct and then start dealing with any special
                            cases.

                                Lists. Then we need to test the pointer to see
                                if&nbsp;it is the null pointer â€“ it might be an
                                empty list. If it is, we need to report that the
                                list is&nbsp;empty and stop. If it isnâ€™t, we
                                need to follow the pointer to the first node.
                                (Remember, a&nbsp;node contains a data item and
                                another pointer). We need to look at the data
                                item at that&nbsp;node. Is it the one that we
                                are looking for? If it is, then we can report
                                that we have found&nbsp;the data item and stop.
                                If it isnâ€™t we need to get the pointer at the
                                node. We then check it&nbsp;because if that
                                pointer is the null pointer we need to report
                                that the data item we are&nbsp;looking for is
                                not in the list and stop. If it isnâ€™t the null
                                pointer, we need to go to the node&nbsp;pointed
                                at by this pointer and repeat. We keep doing
                                this until either we find the data&nbsp;item or
                                we come to the end of the list.</em

                            pseudo-code is language-independent. That means a
                            programmer expert in any language should easily be
                            able to convert pseudo-code&nbsp;into their
                            particular language. With pseudo-code, we can make
                            up any keywords we like so long as they broadly
                            describe what&nbsp;we want to do. An algorithm

                            study&nbsp;the algorithm, there are a number of
                            things to note about it:
                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type: none">

                                <li>
                                  Some Boolean variables have been used to store
                                  whether some events have happened or not.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  All IF and WHILE statements have a
                                  corresponding ENDIF or ENDWHILE statement to
                                  aid clarity.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Programming constructs were used to aid the
                                  step from pseudo-code to writing in actual
                                  code.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Indentation, meaningful variable names and
                                  comments help the reader follow the logic of
                                  the code.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Special cases e.g. if the list is empty in the
                                  first place, if data isn't present in the
                                  list.
                                </li>
                              </ul>
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>
                            Here is the algorithm. See if you can follow it:

                            a new data item BETA to a linked list.

                            For example, suppose the computer needed to add
                            Salmon to the linked list of Fish. The computer
                            inserts Salmon in memory<br />location 850. A
                            diagrammatic representation of the result would look
                            like this:

                          <p>
                            Notice how the pointer at Roach's node has been
                            changed to point to Salmon's location, and the
                            pointer for Salmon has been set&nbsp;to the memory
                            location that was pointed to by Roach's node.

                            Notice that Perch is still in memory location 400.
                            It's just that no pointer points to it anymore so it
                            is not part of the linked list.&nbsp;The computer
                            will keep a record of memory locations that have
                            been freed up, and may at some point overwrite the
                            contents of&nbsp;those memory locations when they
                            are needed again. Also notice that the pointer in
                            the node Carp has now changed. Some&nbsp;further
                            points about linked lists.

                                  Inserting data and deleting data is
                                  straightforward compared to arrays. If you are
                                  storing data in an array&nbsp;in an organised
                                  manner and you want to insert or delete an
                                  item, then you need to actually move the
                                  data&nbsp;items in the array to new locations
                                  to maintain the proper order. You don't have
                                  to do this with linked lists.&nbsp;You just
                                  find the appropriate place and then adjust
                                  appropriate pointers.

                                  To find a piece of data in a linked list, you
                                  have to traverse through all the nodes in a
                                  serial fashion. This&nbsp;can be slow compared
                                  to a direct access data structure, such as an
                                  array.

                                  Linked lists grow and shrink depending on how
                                  much data is stored. There are no blocks of
                                  memory that&nbsp;have been reserved in RAM as
                                  there are with arrays. Linked lists therefore
                                  use RAM more efficiently.

                                  With arrays, you reserve space when the
                                  program is compiled. This doesn't happen with
                                  linked lists. It's&nbsp;possible you might not
                                  be able to store what you want to with a
                                  linked list data structure!
