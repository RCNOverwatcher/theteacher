                            There are a number of ways to describe a system and
                            the flow of data around it. One way is to use a
                            flowchart. We will describe the symbols used in a
                            flowchart and give an example of their use.

                            The following symbols are the most common ones used
                            in flowcharts, although there are others and if you
                            read around this topic, you may find slight
                            variations in their use.

                            is an example of a flowchart that describes the
                            discount given for buying products in a club’s shop.
                            The discount given depends upon your membership

                            There are some useful tools for making flowcharts
                            around. There is a drawing toolbar in both Word and
                            OpenOffice that can be used for drawing neat
                            flowcharts. Meesoft's ‘Diagram Designer’ is also
                            excellent (and free). If your school has Logicator,
                            that's also an excellent way of getting experience
                            producing good flowcharts.
