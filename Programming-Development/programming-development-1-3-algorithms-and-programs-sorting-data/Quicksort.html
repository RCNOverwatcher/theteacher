                            One slightly confusing aspect of quicksort is that
                            sometimes we need to look at the actual data and
                            sometimes we need to look at pointers that point to
                            the position of a data item.

                            The best way to understand how quicksort works is to
                            do an example. Imagine you want to sort these nine

                            REPEAT loop. Line 13 of the pseudo-code says to swap
                            FIRST with the data item pointed to by DOWN. Line 14
                            of the pseudo-code says that PIVOT should then be
