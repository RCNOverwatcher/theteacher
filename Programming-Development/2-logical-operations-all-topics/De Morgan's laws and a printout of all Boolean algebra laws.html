                            >There are a number of rules in Boolean algebra that
                            help us derive and simplify statements. Together
                            these are known as De Morgan's rules. In this
                            section, we will discuss De Morgan's rules. We will
                            see how they are applied in another section, with
                            lots of examples. One use for them that you will
                            discover in another section is that they can be used
                            to simplify NAND and NOR gates in logic gate
                            designs.

                            When we talk about something being 'true', we can
                            also talk about if being a 'one' or being 'high'.
                            When we talk about something being 'false', we can
                            also talk about a 'zero' or a 'low'. It is important

                            According to OCR's specification, the symbol they
                            will use for the disjunction is&nbsp;V so we will
                            try to use this as much as possible, too. At the
                            moment, this rule isn't going to mean much, but if
                            we have a look at our first example, we can see this
                            rule being applied and that it does indeed work.

                            We have two inputs in our expression, which we will
                            call A and B. We'll put the different combinations
                            in the first two columns. The 'negation of the
                            disjunction' is&nbsp;(A&nbsp;V B)' and this will go
                            in the third column. The 'conjunction of the
                            negation' is in the fourth column. Working through
                            the expressions in the third and fourth column, you
                            can see that they are indeed producing the same
                            outputs so De Morgan's second rule works, too.

                            ><br />You can download and print out a summary
                            sheet of all the laws and identities we have
                            covered. It includes the 12 basic laws, the
                            commutative, associative and distributive laws and
                            De Morgan's laws. You should always have a copy of
                            this summary on your table to refer to when working
                            on Boolean algebra, until you know them all by
                            heart!
