                            Like all things, there are a number of terms,
                            jargon, that you need to know when programming.
                          </p>

                            You can think of a variable as a box, the contents
                            of which can change. The programmer sets up a
                            variable at the beginning of a program, giving it a
                            name (an 'identifier') and saying what data type it
                            is (so the computer can reserve the right amount of
                            RAM for the value that the variable will hold). In
                            addition, the programmer may also decide to put a
                            starting value inside the variable. This is known as
                            'initialisation' and means that the variable will
                            have a known value in when the program starts, as
                            opposed to an unknown value. Using variables with
                            names rather than memory address makes programs
                            easier to read. In addition, programs can be loaded
                            anywhere in RAM by the operating system and even in
                            different places in RAM on different occasions! All
                            the operating system has to do is allocate available
                            memory addresses to the variable names!
                          </p>

                            You can think of a constant as a box, the contents
                            of which never change. The programmer sets up a
                            constant at the beginning of a program, giving it a
                            name (an 'identifier') and saying what data type it
                            is (so the computer can reserve the right amount of
                            RAM for the value that the constant will hold). The
                            programmer will then set the value of the constant.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Constants are used in programs so that if the
                            programmer needs to make a change, they only have to
                            make the change in one place. For example, if the
                            VAT rate is needed in many places in a program, the
                            programmer refers to a constant called VAT_RATE. At
                            the beginning of the program, this was declared by
                            the programmer to be 0.175. Suppose the VAT rate
                            changes to 15% in the Budget rather than the 17.5%
                            it was before. All the programmer has to do is
                            change the value where the contant was declared.
                            They don't have to go through the whole program and
                            change every instance where the VAT rate was used.

                            An identifier is the fancy programming word for a
                            name of something that the programmer sets up, like
                            a variable or a constant or an array, for example.
                            The programmer can then refer to those items using
                            their names (rather than the memory addresses). Each
                            programming language has its own rules about what
                            you can and can't use in a name and you should make
                            sure you know what the rules are for the languages
                            you are learning on your course.

                            Reserved words or keywords are words that the
                            programmer cannot use as identifiers because they
                            are used by the actual programming language. For
                            example, FOR and IF and INTEGER are keywords in most
                            languages and couldn't be used as a variable name.
                            All programming languages have a list of reserved
                            words.
