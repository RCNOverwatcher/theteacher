<h1 style="text-align: center;">Constants and variables</h1>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>There are a number of different methods of storing data in a program that a programmer might want to use. Two of the most common ways are by using 'constants' and 'variables'.</p>
 
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/0a30924b-127c-42db-b2ee-9ccf0dc54eb7Constant.GIF" alt="Constant"></p>
<p><strong>Constants</strong><br>A constant is a data value which is fixed. It cannot change, so it is 'constant'. When we write programs in a high level language, we can set up constants by assigning them to a variable which cannot change. If we want to use a constant, we have to 'declare' it first. That means tell the program that it is a constant, give it a name and a value. For example, at the beginning of a Java program, we might declare a constant for pi like this;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>const pi = 3.14</strong></p>
<p>Each time we want to use pi in our program, perhaps to calculate the area of a circle, we can use the actual word 'pi' rather than the actual number in the programming code. Why would we want to do that? The answer to this question is that it makes it easier to read and understand what the code is doing, especially if we have to make changes in the future. There is a second important reason. If the VAT rate (the tax that the Government puts on everything that is sold in shops) is 17.5% at the moment, we might declare a constant like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>const VAT = 17.5</strong></p>
<p>Each time we need to do a calculation in our program, we can use the constant VAT instead of 17.5, which as we have already said, makes the program easier to read and understand. Imagine that we have used VAT a hundred times in the program. If the Government changes the VAT rate from 17.5% to 20%, we only have to make the change in our program once, where we declared the constant:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>const VAT = 20.0</strong></p>
<p>We don't have to go through the program and change 17.5 to 20.0 everywhere we used the value. By using a constant, we can save ourselves a lot of time when changes have to be made.</p>
<p><strong>Program maintenance</strong><br>Remember, programs are rarely written and then left to work without any future changes. They change, sometimes years into the future from when they were originally written (perhaps because a bug was found, or a change was made in the law that means the program has to be modified, or the company wants a new feature added, for example). Any change that has to be made may be done by a different person to the original programmer. Making changes in the future in programming is known as 'maintenance'. We therefore have to write programs that are easy to read, understand and change whenever we can so that 'program maintenance' can take place.</p>
<p><strong>Variables</strong><br>A variable is a name we give to a particular memory location that stores a piece of data. The name we give is more properly called an 'identifier' because it identifies a piece of data. You can think of a variable as a box. The box has a name (an identifier to identify the box) and it stores data. If we want to use a variable, we have to 'declare' it first. That means give it a name and say what kind of data it will hold (a real number, an integer, a string, a Boolean value, and so on). This is done in different ways, depending upon the programming language you are using. For example, in Java:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>int temperature</strong></p>
<p>declares a variable. The identifier is temperature and it holds holds an integer (a whole number, with no decimal parts).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>string surname</strong></p>
<p>declares a variable. The identifier is surname and it holds a string value (anything number of characters from the keyboard).</p>
<p>Once you have declared a variable, you can use it in a program. You can have a look at what value the variable is holding. You can use it as part of a calculation and you can change the value it holds. If you know the value you want the variable to start off with in a program, you can declare it and also give it a value at the same time. For example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>int temperature = 45</strong></p>
<p>declares an Integer variable called 'temperature' and gives it 45.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>String surname "Smith"</strong></p>
<p>declares a String variable called 'surname' and gives it a value of 'Smith'.</p>
<p>If you forget to declare a variable in a program, you will get an error when you try to translate the program into object code.</p>
<p><strong>Variables and memory locations</strong><br>What you should notice about a variable is that you, the programmer, have no idea where in memory, in RAM, the data is actually stored. The programmer doesn't need to know. All the programmer needs to know is what the identifier is called and then to use that in their program. In fact, when any program is run a number of different times, it is very likely that the computer will decide to use different memory locations for each identifier every different time! That is fine as far as the programmer is concerned - they will only ever use the identifier. What happens in the background is unimportant to the programmer.</p>
<p><strong>Changing values held in a variable</strong><br>Variables are very useful for the above reason. They are also useful because the values in variables can change. We said at the beginning of this section on variables that you can think of a variable as a box with a name (or identifier) on it. At any time while the program is running, the program can reach in and get what is in the box and look at it or use it, simply by using its name. You can also put something new into the box, which overwrites what is already in there. For example, after declaring a variable called temperature and setting it to 45, like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>int temperature = 45</strong></p>
<p>we can later in the program change the value of the variable temperature using this instruction:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>temperature = 60</strong></p>
<p>We only need to declare the variable once, but can change the value it holds as many times as we like after it has been declared. Variables are incredibly useful in a program!</p>
<p><strong>Meaningful names</strong><br>The last thing to say about constants and variables is that they should always be given meaningful names. A constant called 'constant1' or a variable called 'temp1' does not help a program to be easily read, understood and modified in the future. It does not help program maintenance.</p>
