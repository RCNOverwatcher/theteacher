<h1 class="ContentHeading" style="text-align: center;" align="center">Precedence in Maths and Boolean operators</h1>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong><span class="NormalContentHeading">Introduction</span></strong><br> Precedence refers to the order in which you carry out the parts of a calculation. 3 + 4 * 2 = 11, not 14 because you always do multiplication before addition. Note that multiplication and division are the same, just as subtraction is the same as addition because it is just adding a negative number</p>
 
<p class="NormalContent"><strong><span class="NormalContentHeading">Maths operators</span></strong><br> You may be familiar from Maths that&nbsp;the order in which you do a calculation depends on the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li class="NormalContent">Do multiplication and division first.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">Then do addition and subtraction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="NormalContent">This is why 3 + 4 * 2 = 11 not 14. You do have the option, however, of changing the order the calculations are done, by using brackets. Brackets have a higher order of precedence than multiplication / division and addition / subtraction.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li class="NormalContent">Do whatever is in brackets first.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">Then do multiplication and division first.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">Then do addition and subtraction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="NormalContent">So (3 + 4) * 2 = 14 not 11, because you do what is on brackets first.</p>
<p class="NormalContent">2 + 4 * 4 - 1 = 17, because you do the 4 * 4 first, to get 16, then add 2 and subtract 1.</p>
<p class="NormalContent">(2 + 4) * 4 - 1 = 23 because you do the 2 + 4 first, to get 6. You then multiply 6 by 4 to get 24. Finally, you subtract 1 to get 23.</p>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong><span class="NormalContentHeading">Boolean operators</span></strong><br> If you have a Boolean expression that uses a number of operators, the order of precedence is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li class="NormalContent">Do NOT first.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">Then do AND.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">Then do OR.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="NormalContent">Again, brackets can be used to ensure parts of expressions are done first as they have a higher precedence.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li class="NormalContent">Do whatever is in brackets first.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">Then do NOT next.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">Then do AND.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">Then do OR.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="NormalContent">For example, if you had to search through a database of books:</p>
<p class="NormalContent" align="center"><strong>WHERE Subject = "Maths" OR Subject = "Physics" AND Cost &lt; £15.00</strong></p>
<p class="NormalContent">you would find the Physics books costing less than £15.00 first, and then get those books OR Maths books in the database (because AND is done before OR). You could change the meaning of the expression though:</p>
<p class="NormalContent" align="center"><strong>WHERE (Subject = "Maths" OR Subject = "Physics") AND Cost &lt; £15.00</strong></p>
<p class="NormalContent" align="left">This would get all the Maths or Physics books first and then get those books which were under £15.00.</p>
<p class="NormalContent" align="left">It is always a good idea to use brackets in programming, whether or not they are needed. They often help make your program more readable and easier to follow.</p>
