                            that make up computers use energy in their
                            manufacture. The majority of energy sources
                            contribute in various degrees to polluting the
                            atmosphere and the environment. It has been
                            estimated that to build just one computer requires
                            approximately ten times its weight in chemicals and
                            energy!&nbsp;

                                  Over 1000 different chemicals, including lead,

                            Around the world, we continue to make computers in
                            huge quantities. Approximately 150 million will be
                            made in the next 12 months alone. If you then
                            multiply that number by the amount of energy,
                            chemicals and water required, it is not difficult to
                            see how computers contribute to pollution. If you
                            also consider that a typical PC would be lucky to be
                            in use for just three years (compared to 10 - 15
                            years for a car and about 15 for a fridge), you can
                            get an idea of the numbers of PCs involved.

                            European legislation has been introduced that
                            demands 70% of a PC is recycled when it is finally
                            scrapped. Whilst governments have encouraged
                            recycling, some people have argued that this is the
                            <em>wrong</em> approach. It takes a lot of energy,
                            they argue, to recycle computers! It can also in
                            itself be the cause of environmental damage. For
                            example, PCs are being transported to developing
                            countries such as China for recycling. The process
                            to recover metals such as copper, lead and gold from
                            computer hardware involves the use of acid baths â€“
                            and this is not good for the environment. It is also
                            not good for the people directly involved in the
                            recovery process. This is because health and safety
                            standards are well below those of the developed
                            countries and the appropriate protective equipment
                            is rarely provided.

                            number of computers being built in the first place.
                            This could be done, for example, by:
                          </p>

                                  their entire PC.

                                  the more trees have to be cut down. Even if
                                  these are from renewable sources, turning
                                  trees into paper involves energy as well as
                                  involves making parts of forests an eyesore.
