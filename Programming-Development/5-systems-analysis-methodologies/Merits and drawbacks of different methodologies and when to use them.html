                                  can badly impact on a project.

                            <strong>Agile, RAD and Spiral methodologies</strong
                            ><br />In some respects, RAD and Spiral
                            methodologies are forerunners to Agile
                            methodologies. There are some key differences,
                            though and they should certainly be considered
                            different methodologies. RAD and Spiral
                            methodologies are based on the production of a
                            series of prototypes, which are then used to build
                            the product. Agile methodologies don't encourage the
                            development of prototypes - the project story is
                            broken down at the start into a storyboard and then
                            developed in an agreed order. Changes are expected
                            at any time and planned for in Agile methodologies
                            but this is not the case with the RAD and the Spiral
                            approach. RAD and spiral methodology team members
                            are generally specialists in their own fields
                            whereas Agile methodologies encourage everyone to be
                            generalists, able to do any task that needs doing.
                            Similarly, the comunication that takes place in RAD
                            and spiral methodologies can be compartmentalised
                            compared to the more open nature of the Agile
                            approach - the poor communications that can happen
                            easily in RAD, Spiral and also Waterfall projects
                            are always a major reason why projects go off-track
                            or fail altogether.&nbsp;
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <strong>How to select a methodology</strong
                            ><br />Agile methodologies are more flexible than
                            the waterfall approach. This is a useful approach if
                            it is difficult for the customer to specify exactly
                            what they need at the start of the project or if
                            there are likely to be changes. If you have a
                            skilled team of programmers and developers who are
                            adaptable and independent, then you are more likely
                            to benefit from using this methodology to manage a
                            project.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If you can guarantee that the requirements won't
                            change, there is little uncertainty of any other
                            changes in the project, the project is a simple one
                            or the customers involved have only have positive
                            experiences of the Waterfall approach, then a
                            Waterfall methodology still might be worth
                            considering, as might the RAD and Spiral
                            methodologies.
