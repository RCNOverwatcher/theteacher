                            >Library programs are available on most modern
                            operating systems such as Windows and Linux. They
                            are programs that have been written by experienced
                            programmers. The programs carry out specific jobs
                            that may be frequently needed by the developers of
                            new applications.

                          <p>
                            For example, a user may be developing a new
                            application that needs to be able to:
                          </p>
                          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                            <li style="list-style-type: none">
                              <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                                <li>write data to a storage device</li>
                                <li>
                                  transfer data from one storage device to
                                  another
                                </li>
                                <li>open a Window with a menu on it</li>
                                <li>send a file to a printer</li>
                                <li>use a scanner.</li>
                              </ul>
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>
                            Because these actions are so common, a library of
                            programs are written and then made available to
                            users. They may come as part of an operating system
                            or they may be bought, loaded onto a computer or
                            network and then be made available to users. All a
                            developer has to do is ‘CALL’ a particular program
                            when they need it from within their own program.
                            Using library routines is a great idea! The code for
                            any particular function in a library has already
                            been written and therefore time and money doesn’t
                            have to be spent ‘reinventing the wheel’ by writing
                            the code again.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The code in a library program will have been written
                            by experienced programmers and will have undergone
                            thorough testing. It is therefore likely that the
                            library program will not contain any programming
                            errors, known as ‘bugs’. It can be relied on to
                            work. Because the library programs are called up
                            only when they are needed and already present on the
                            computer, a new application being developed will be
                            smaller in size than if it had to have its own code
                            to do particular functions. This means that it needs
                            less storage space on the hard drive and less RAM
                            when it is being run.
