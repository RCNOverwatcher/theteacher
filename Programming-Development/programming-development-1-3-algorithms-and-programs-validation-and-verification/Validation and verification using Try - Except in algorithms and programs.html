                            Many languages have special routines built into them
                            to catch rogue data entry values. These are called
                            'exceptions'. Python for example, has a number of
                            built-in instructions it can use to look for
                            specific exceptions. For example, you could use one
                            of these to make sure the user enters in only
                            numbers and not letters. If a user enters in a
                            letter when a number was expected, then an
                            'exception handling routine' is run to deal with the
                            error. The general format for looking for an
                            exception in Python is:
                          </p>
                          <p style="margin-left: 30px">

                              >&nbsp; &nbsp; do these instructions if there is a
                              problem with the input<br /></strong

                              Here is an example of it being used. In this
                              program, a number has to be entered. If a letter
                              is entered, then an exception handling routine
                              deals with it.</span

                            for. You have to look up what is available in
                            whatever language you are using and read the
                            descriptions for them. In Python, you can get
