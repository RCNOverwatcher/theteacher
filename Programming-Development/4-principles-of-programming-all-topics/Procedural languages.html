                            >Procedural languages are sometimes called
                            'imperative' languages. This comes from English
                            grammar! The imperative form of a verb is where you
                            give a command. For example, in the verb 'to stand',
                            the imperative form of the verb is 'Stand'. It's a
                            command to tell someone to stand up. An imperative
                            language is therefore one where the instructions in
                            the language are simply commands that tell the
                            program exactly what to do next.

                            Compare an imperative language with an example a
                            fourth generation language, such as SQL:

                            table. What it doesn't do is what a procedural
                            language would have to do; it doesn't say how you
                            create the table and how you are going to read all
                            the contents from the table and where you are going
                            to store the data whilst you are using it.

                            ><br />These types of languages are third generation
                            languages and examples include BASIC and Pascal.
                            Programs are laid out using three control
                            structures. These are sequence, selection and
                            iteration (repetition). In addition, programs are
                            typically broken down into logical blocks, each of
                            which carries out one task. These are known by a
                            variety of names, including function, procedure,
                            subroutine, module and unit. Programs make use of
                            variable names, which are just real words that
                            describe memory locations holding data. Whilst it
                            might not seem that important, it actually makes the
                            whole program much easier to read, understand and
                            importantly, debug (find any errors in the code).

                            >When you look at any high-level language, you can
                            identify the features in the language that make it
                            so powerful. Instructions in a program flow one
                            after another in a sequence. However, there are
                            instructions available that will allow blocks of
                            code to be repeated many times. There are also
                            instructions that allow decisions to be made about
                            which code from a selection of code will be
                            executed. The specific instructions provided by a
                            particular language that allow code to be repeated,
                            or code to be selected from a choice of code, are
                            known as <strong>control structures</strong>. If we
                            also include the way that instructions flow one
                            after the other, we can say that there are three
                            types of programming construct we need to know
                            about. These we will call:

                            There isn't a lot to say about the programming
                            construction 'sequence'. It simply describes one
                            instruction following on from the next instruction.
                            An example of this, in pseudo-code, is:

                            A selection construct looks at some data held in a
                            variable and tests it. If the result of the test is
                            TRUE, we do one block of code. If the result of the
                            test is FALSE, we do a different block of code. In
                            this way, we can alter the program flow and
                            execution. Some blocks of code may never get
                            executed at all whilst others will get
                            executed.&nbsp;

                            Iterative constructs (also known as repetitive
                            constructs) repeat the same block of code a number
                            of times. Sometimes, an iterative instruction will
                            say how many times a particular block of code should
                            be repeated. Other types of iterative instructions
                            will tell a program to repeat a block of code
                            constantly, but before the code is run again, a test
                            is carried out. The code is run only if the test
                            result is TRUE. Eventually, the test returns a FALSE
                            and the block of code isn't done any more.
