                            >With procedural languages, we typically break a
                            problem down into functions. (In some languages like
                            Python, we only have functions but in other
                            languages like Pascal, there are functions and
                            procedures, each doing a similar but different job).
                            Each function in a typical solution does just one
                            task and we call this 'modular programming'. To run
                            this program, our main program is simply a series of
                            calls to the different functions. We can use many
                            programming languages either in a procedural way, or
                            using an object oriented approach. Let's see an
                            example of both approaches using Python 3.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Here is a program that calculates an electricty
                            using a procedural approach. We have four functions.
                            The actual program is started by calling the first
                            function using main() at the bottom of the code.
                            This calls the function called main() which in turn
                            asks the user to enter the number of kWh units
                            they've used, and then calls three functions. The
                            first one multiplies the units by the cost per unit.
                            The second one adds a standing charge. The third one
                            is in charge of displaying the total correctly. Each
                            function carries out one and only one job (modular
                            programming) and the main program simply consists of
                            a function call. Note, that if you are unsure of any
                            of the code e.g. the formatting code for the total,
                            then you should refer to the Python course on out
                            website.

                            What happens when you enter in a postitive whole
                            number? how about a real number? What about a letter
                            instead of a number? How about a negative number?
                            Try and make the code fail. You should find, for
                            example, that the code accepts negative numbers. Is
                            this correct? What might you do about it if you
                            think it is incorrect?

                          <p>Now let's look at an OO approach.&nbsp;</p>

                          <p>
                            You should write the code under the first program
                            you wrote and then get them both working together,
                            so you can confirm the answers are the same for both
                            programs when you run it (although we haven't added
                            an exception for our OO program using try - except).

                            <strong>Classes, attributes and methods</strong
                            ><br />The OO program starts by making a 'class'.
                            This is a blueprint, a template for the calculations
                            for a bill. In other programs, we might create a
                            class for a student, for example. This wouldn't be
                            for an actual student, but it is a template for a
                            student, showing what data (called attributes) is
                            being kept about the student and what calculations
                            and operations needs to happen on the data (called
                            'methods'). Inside our definition of the
                            calculateBill class, you can see the data we need to
                            use and some of the methods that can be called.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <strong>Objects</strong><br />Once you have a class,
                            you can then use it to create actual real
                            'instances' of the class. An instance of a class is
                            called an object. You might have a class defining
                            what a student is, but you must create an instance
                            of the class 'Mary Smith' to get an actual, real
                            student. When you create an object, they have all of
                            the attributes and all of the methods defined in
                            their class. We created an object in our code with
                            this line:
                          </p>
                          <p style="margin-left: 30px">
                            <strong>myBill = calculateBill()</strong>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            This tells the program to create a real object
                            called myBill using the class called
                            calculateBill(). Now myBill has the methods
                            costPower and addStanding. The other method, that
                            starts with the line def __init__(self) is a special
                            method. When you&nbsp;

                          <p>
                            <strong>Dot notation</strong><br />Once I have a
                            real object, I can use any of the methods in the
                            object using dot notation. For example, to use the
                            method costPower, I used this line:
                          </p>
                          <p style="margin-left: 30px">
                            <strong
                              >total1 = myBill.costPower(unitsUsed)</strong
                            >
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <strong>MyBill.costPower(unitsUsed)</strong> says to
                            the program, '<em
                              >go to the object called myBill. Then call the
                              method costPower using the data in unitsUsed</em
                            >'.&nbsp;
