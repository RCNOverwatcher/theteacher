                            <strong>O(N) in programming</strong><br />A good
                            example in programming of an algorithm that is of
                            order n is a search algorithm. If you had to count
                            the items in an array that matched a particular
                            number, you would have to visit each element in the
                            array and test it. If the array had 10 numbers in,
                            you would have to make 10 comparisons, one for each
                            element. If the array had 300 elements, you would
                            have to make 300 comparisons and if there were
                            20000, you would need to visit the array 20000 times
                            to get your answer. We can represent this using a
                            graph:
                          </p>

                            <strong>An example in Python</strong><br />The
                            performance is directly proportionally related to
                            the size of the data you are using. For example, if
                            you have to add 5 numbers together, you could write
                            a recursive algorithm that adds the first two
                            numbers together, and then adds the next one to the
                            answer, then adds the next one to the answer, and so
                            on until the final answer is reached. Here is the
                            Python code to do this:
                          </p>
                          <p style="margin-left: 30px">
                            <strong>def myList(listOfNumbers):</strong
                            ><br /><strong> if len(listOfNumbers) == 1:</strong
                            ><br /><strong
                              >&nbsp; &nbsp; return listOfNumbers[0]</strong
                            ><br /><strong> else:</strong><br /><strong
                              >&nbsp; &nbsp; return listOfNumbers[0] +
                              myList(listOfNumbers[1:])</strong
                            >
                          </p>
                          <p style="margin-left: 30px">
                            <strong>print(myList([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]))</strong>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The more numbers you have to add, the more recursive
                            calls you have to make. If you had to add 10
                            numbers, you would need to make 10 calls to the
                            function recursively. If you had to add 20 numbers,
                            you would

                              recursively.</span
                            >&nbsp;This relationship is therefore linear and we
                            represent this in Big O notation using O(n).

                            /><br />This code creates an array of 20 numbers
                            between 1 and 5. It then searches for how many
                            matches are made for the number 4. By altering the
                            size of the array, you can see that the number of
                            comparisons is directly related to the size of the
                            array.

                            finding an element using a linear search.
