                            An insertion sort program in Python

                          <p>
                            We saw in the previous work how an insertion sort
                            actually works. The insertion sort algorithm we had
                            didn't really 'roll off the tongue' so we are going
                            to tidy it up and write it in pseudo-code:

                            What we are doing is exactly what we described in
                            the previous lesson. We are starting with the data
                            at the second element position (at position 1, not
                            2, remember) and comparing it to the data at the
                            first element position. If the data in the first
                            position is bigger than the data in the second
                            position, we have to swap them. Then we look at the
                            data in the third position. We do exactly the same
                            as above, comparing position 3 with 2, and then if
                            necessary, position 2 with 1.

                            <strong>Q1.</strong> Writing code from an algorithm
                            takes some practice. Type this in using Python and
                            get it working. Test it thoroughly and check it
                            carefully. Just because code runs and gives you some
                            results doesn't mean the results are correct!
