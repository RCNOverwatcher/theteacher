<h1 style="text-align: center;">A simple introduction to hash tables</h1>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong><strong>Introduction<br></strong></strong>A hash table is a type of data structure. You apply a Maths formula to a piece of data that you want to store. This generates a number, which corresponds to a position in a hash table. Hash tables are very fast because you can calculate and then go to a piece of data you want to find, without having to search sequentially through lots of other pieces of data to get to it.</p>
 
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>An example of how hash tables work&nbsp;</strong><br></span>A database of pupils is going to be organised using a hash table. This file structure has been chosen because the database will&nbsp;be used to deal with pupil/parent enquiries and so needs to retrieve each record quickly.&nbsp;The secretary dealing with enquiries will type in a pupil's surname to get their data back. The database designer has selected the&nbsp;following maths formula, known as a ‘hash algorithm’:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>When a surname is typed in, convert each letter of the surname into a&nbsp;number, and then add the numbers together to give an address. Convert&nbsp;letters to numbers using A=1, B=2, C=3 ... X=24, Y=25, Z=26.</em></strong></p>
<p>For example, when the secretary types Jones, this is converted into 10 + 15 + 14 + 5 + 19 = 63. The computer goes to memory&nbsp;address 63 and there's the start of the record!&nbsp;If you wanted to store ‘Jones’ instead, you would work out the memory address you are going to store the data in by applying&nbsp;the hashing algorithm to the data.&nbsp;This is a much-simplified example but does illustrate the basic idea. It is a way of converting a request for a file into an address,&nbsp;so the record can be retrieved immediately, without having to go through other records.</p>
<p><strong>Good hashing algorithms</strong><br>Creating a hash file is an excellent way of creating a fast access file structure. You do need, of course, a direct access storage&nbsp;device, not a magnetic tape, for example. You also need to ensure that you have a 'good' hashing algorithm. The one above is&nbsp;very poor indeed because there will be lots of different surnames that give the same memory address! This is called a 'clash' or&nbsp;'collision'. You need to design a hashing algorithm that minimises clashes because they slow down access times. On the other&nbsp;hand, an algorithm might also spread out the data so much that large areas of storage are used up! Having large areas of&nbsp;storage that aren't used efficiently is known as ‘redundancy’. A further consideration is the hashing algorithm itself. It mustn’t&nbsp;be so complicated that it takes ages to calculate anything!</p>
<p>A good hashing algorithm will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimise clashes.</li>
<li>Ensure that the hash codes of data aren't spread too far apart, wasting memory.</li>
<li>Be quick to calculate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dealing with clashes</strong><br>Some clashes (collisions) are inevitable. When they do happen, there are two techniques that can be used to deal with the&nbsp;situation:</p>
<p>1) The computer can still go to the memory address that was calculated by the hashing algorithm. It then starts&nbsp;searching sequentially from that point to either find the data that it was searching for or to store the data it wanted&nbsp;to store.<br>2) The computer can set-up an overflow area. When there is a clash, the computer can jump to this special area to&nbsp;either find the data that it was searching for or to store the data it wanted to store.</p>
