                            >There are a number of in-built methods we could use
                            to implement a queue structure. Lists have append
                            and pop functions which we could use, for example.
                            If you add an item to the end of a queue, these
                            functions will be fast. If you remove an item from
                            the front, however, they will be slow (in computing
                            terms) because not only do you have to remove the
                            item, you have to shift all of the other items along
                            as well. In Big O terms, using lists in this way is
                            rated as an O(n) operation. A much better approach
                            would be to use a library with a specific object
                            designed for fast queue manipulation. Python comes
                            with a library called collections, and in there, is
                            'deque'. This is pronounced 'deck' (not 'de-queue')
                            and will allow us to create an efficient queue data
                            structure. Using Big O notation, it improves our
                            operations in our queue to a 0(1) from the list's
                            O(n) efficiency. Deques could also be used for
                            implementing stacks, although we used a different
                            approach (writing our own functions and class) when
                            we looked at that.

                            <strong>Collections deque</strong><br />Deque comes
                            with a wide range of in-built functions, including
                            append, popleft, clear and count. You can set the
                            queue to be an umlimited size, or make it a fixed
                            size. We can also use other functions such as
                            <strong><em>len</em></strong> and
                            <strong><em>in</em></strong
                            >. You can find a summary of all of the functions by

                            <strong><em>deque</em></strong> from
                            <strong><em>collections</em></strong
                            >. We then tried out some of the available functions
                            in deque, carefully printing out the results after
                            each experiment and checking that the queue worked
                            in the way we expected it to. We should note that
                            when using this deque object to implement a stack or
                            a queue, the data structures are not strictly
                            enforced; it is possible to do operations on the
                            data in the stack or queue in a way that is
                            inconsistent with how they should work (as a FIFO
                            data structure for queues or a LIFO data structure
                            for stacks, for example). It is up to the programmer
                            to use the range of functions in a way consistent
                            with the data structure being created and used. This
                            could be a source of programming bugs, however, so
                            care must be taken!

                            As you can see, we have only provided a method to
                            add an item to the back of the queue and remove one
                            from the front, in addition to some methods to check
                            if the queue is empty and to get its size. This
                            would be fine for a FIFO queue, but we should note
                            that there are other types of queues - we could
                            easily add extra methods to our class if we needed
                            to. For example, we could add a method to add an
                            item to the front of the queue as well as the back,
                            or one that can remove an item from the back of the
                            queue as well as the front. We could also add a
                            method to print out the contents of the whole queue.
                          </p>

                            the front of the queue as well as the back, and one
                            that can remove an item from the back of the queue
                            as well as the front. <br /><strong>Q2.</strong> Add
                            a method to print out the contents of the queue.<br /><strong
