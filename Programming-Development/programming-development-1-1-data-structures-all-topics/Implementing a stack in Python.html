                            >A stack can be implemented in Python easily using
                            lists and list methods. There are broadly two
                            approaches that can be used. We can simply create
                            the functions we need, or if we are using an
                            Objected Oriented approach, we can create a class
                            and use that. In both cases, we could put the code
                            into our own library. That way, when we need a stack
                            in the future, we don't have to rewrite the code and
                            test it. We just import the library and use the
                            stack.

                            ><br />Here is some code to create a stack and the
                            functions needed to display the contents, pushing
                            and popping items and testing it to see if it is
                            empty.

                            When you run the code, you can see that because we
                            are using a list, we can hold a mixture of data
                            types and structures.

                            <strong>Creating a library of functions</strong
                            ><br />Stacks are useful data structures. We can
                            store these functions in our own library, and use
                            them in the future rather than rewriting them
                            whenever we need one. We need to remove everything
                            except the functions from our code above. We also
                            need to ensure that we can pass the stack name and
                            size we are using from our main program to the
                            library functions. The library functions must be
                            generic; they must work with any stack name and any
                            stack size. Store the following as a file called
                            <em><strong>my_library.py</strong></em> .

                            <strong>Using the library</strong><br />To use an
                            existing library of functions, you need to import
                            the library into your new program. The simplest way
                            to do this is to make sure that the library is in
                            <strong><em>the same folder</em></strong> as your
                            new program. Here is an example of using the library
                            we just created:
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <img
                              style="vertical-align: middle"
                              src="images/e10ebf30-e13c-48a8-aa44-a02cd48a782cfunctions_lib_use.GIF"
                              alt="functions lib use"
                              width="330"
                              height="242"
                            />
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            As you can see, we imported the library in our main
                            program and then created a new stack and specified
                            its size. These parameters were then passed to the
                            functions in the library using the dot notation, the
                            library name followed by a dot and then name of the
                            function, along with any parameters needed.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <strong>Using an Object Oriented approach</strong
                            ><br />If you are using an OO approach in Python, we
                            can create a class called Stack in a library. We can
                            then import and use that when we need to in another
                            program. Again, make sure the library (which we will
                            call <em><strong>stack1.py</strong></em
                            >) and main program are in the same folder. Here is
                            the code for the class, which is stored in the
                            library:

                          <p>
                            Here is an example program that uses the class in
                            the library.

                            Investigate how you would import a library if it
                            wasn't in the same folder as the program that used
                            the library.<br /><strong>Q4.</strong> It can be a
                            little bit tedious and time-consuming having to use
                            the dot notation and typing in long library names
                            and long function names. Investigate how you could
                            reduce this problem.
