                            >We can store data in a number of different types of
                            data structure. One kind of data structure involves
                            creating 'hash tables'. Hash tables involve using a
                            maths formula known as a 'hashing algorithm' to turn
                            data that you want to store (the 'hash key') into a
                            set of numbers (the 'hash code'). What we end up
                            with a table of pairs of data, each pair being made
                            up of a hash key and a hash code. The reason that
                            this is done is that it is a lot quicker to search
                            through hash codes and then find the corresponding
                            hash key than it is searching through the hash keys
                            themselves.&nbsp;

                              example, 12 MOD 8 = 4 (because 8 goes into 12 once
                              with a remainder of 4). 26 MOD 8 = 2 (because 8

                              hashing algorithms. As long as the same procedure

                              algorithm, and this is a collision. Using

                              the diagram below. All the data items in the

                            ><br />Creating a hash file is an excellent way of
                            creating a fast access file structure. You do need,
                            of course, a direct access storage&nbsp;device, not
                            a magnetic tape, for example. You also need to
                            ensure that you have a 'good' hashing algorithm. The
                            ones discussed above are not so good because they
                            will generate lots of collisions, and each collision
                            is something that a program has to deal with. That
                            means time is used up and processing is slowed down.
                            This may not seem important when you only have a few
                            hundred records, but when you have a few hundred
                            million records, it can mean the difference between
                            seeing the results on the screen in a second or
                            seeing the results on the screen in a few minutes,

                            You need to design a hashing algorithm that
                            minimises clashes because they slow down access
                            times. A further consideration is the hashing
                            algorithm itself. It mustn’t&nbsp;be so complicated
                            that it takes ages to calculate anything!&nbsp;A
