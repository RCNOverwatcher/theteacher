                            Common operations on numeric and Boolean data

                          <p>
                            <strong>Introduction</strong><br />We often have to
                            perform common operations on both numeric and
                            Boolean data. Over time and with experience, this
                            becomes easier. The more actual examples we try out,
                            the more we can understand what is happening and how
                            to do something. The trick is to build up lots of
                            examples we can refer back to and build up
                            experience.

                            <strong>Common operations on numeric data</strong
                            ><br />We often have to add, subtract, multiply and
                            divide numbers in programming. This can be easily
                            achieved in our programs. Let us declare two
                            variables of data type Integer and one of type Real:
                          </p>
                          <p style="margin-left: 30px">
                            <strong>int firstnumber</strong><br /><strong>
                              int secondnumber</strong
                            ><br /><strong> real result</strong>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            We can add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers in
                            the following way:
                          </p>
                          <p style="margin-left: 30px">
                            <strong>result = firstnumber + secondnumber</strong
                            ><br /><strong>
                              result = firstnumber - secondnumber</strong
                            ><br /><strong>
                              result = firstnumber * secondnumber</strong
                            ><br /><strong>
                              result = firstnumber / secondnumber</strong
                            >
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Result had to be declared as a Real number because
                            when we divide one number by another number, there
                            is a good chance that the result will have a
                            fractional part.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <strong>Common operations on Boolean data</strong
                            ><br />Boolean variables are really useful in
                            programming because they give you a way of doing
                            tests. Depending on the outcome of the test, you can
                            then do or not do some action. For example, let us
                            first declare a Boolean variable in pseudo-code with
                            an identifier 'wonthelottery' like this:
                          </p>
                          <p style="margin-left: 30px">
                            <strong>wonthelottery : Boolean</strong>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Once it has been declared, we can then set its value
                            to true or false, like this:
                          </p>
                          <p style="margin-left: 30px">
                            <strong>wonthelottery = true or</strong
                            ><br /><strong> wonthelottery = false</strong>
                          </p>
                          <p>Now we can use the Boolean value to do a test:</p>
                          <p style="margin-left: 30px">
                            <strong>IF (wonthelottery = true) THEN</strong
                            ><br /><strong
                              >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PRINT
                              "Congratulations"</strong
                            ><br /><strong> ELSE</strong><br /><strong
                              >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PRINT "Better luck next
                              time"</strong
                            ><br /><strong> ENDIF</strong>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            We look inside the brackets of (wonthelottery =
                            true) and ask ourselves if this is a true statement.
                            if it is, then we would print 'Congratulations'. If
                            it is not true i.e. false, then print 'Better luck
                            next time'.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            We can build up quite complex tests using Boolean
                            variables. Let's declare another variable:
                          </p>
                          <p style="margin-left: 30px">
                            <strong>wontheluckynumber : Boolean</strong>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            We could now test to see if we have either one the
                            lottery or the lucky number draw by using OR:
                          </p>
                          <p style="margin-left: 30px">

                              >IF (wonthelottery = true) OR (wontheluckynumber =
                              true) THEN</strong
                            ><br /><strong
                              >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PRINT
                              "Congratulations"</strong
                            ><br /><strong> ELSE</strong><br /><strong
                              >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PRINT "Better luck next
                              time"</strong
                            ><br /><strong> ENDIF</strong>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            As long as any one of the statements in brackets are
                            true (or both of them are true, then
                            'Congratulations' will be printed, else 'Better luck
                            next time' will be printed.
                          </p>
                          <p>Let's declare yet another variable:</p>
                          <p style="margin-left: 30px">
                            <strong>sixteenorover : Boolean</strong>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            We can now use this to check whether the winner is
                            sixteen or over.
                          </p>
                          <p style="margin-left: 30px">
                            <strong
                              >IF ((wonthelottery = true) OR (wontheluckynumber
                              = true)) AND (sixteenorover = true) THEN</strong
                            ><br /><strong
                              >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PRINT
                              "Congratulations"</strong

                          </p>
                          <p>
                            This time, you print 'Congratulations if either
                            wonthelottery OR wontheluckynumber is true, AND the
