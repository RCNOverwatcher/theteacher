                            of numbers, such as 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9. How would you
                            go about this? In programming, we might decide to
                            use a loop, or we could use a technique known as
                            'divide and conquer' and use a recursive routine. We
                            will investigate both approaches.

                            solution because apart from anything else, it works.
                            However, there is another way. In programming, there
                            is a technique known as 'divide and conquer'. This
                            means that we try and break down the problem into
                            smaller problems, solve each of the smaller problems
                            using recursion and then recombine the solutions to
                            the smaller problems to get the answer to the
                            original problem.&nbsp;

                              use listOfNumbers[0]. Also note that [1:] takes a
                              list and gets all of the elements from position 1
                              (i.e. the second element) to the end of the list,
                              a process called 'splicing' a list.&nbsp;</span

                          <p>
                            Notice the
                            <strong><em>if statement</em></strong> checks to see
                            if there is just one element in the list. If there
                            is, it returns it and finishes as that is the
                            answer. As we have already said, it is important to
                            have a line like this in a recursive function
                            because this is the line that will allow you to exit
                            the recursive function. If you didn't have this
                            line, you would constantly call the function you are
                            in and eventually, you would run out of memory and
                            the program would stop with a 'stack overfow' error.

                          <p>
                            <strong>Why is this function 'recursive'?</strong
                            ><br />
                            This is recursive function because it calls itself.
                            If you look on the fifth line,
                            <em
                              ><strong
                                >return listOfNumbers[0] +
                                myList(listOfNumbers[1:])</strong
                              ></em
                            >&nbsp;this says, get the first element in the list
                            and add it to all of the other elements in the list,
                            apart from the first one. The last part of this line
                            is another call to the function you are currently
                            in. This is another call to add a list! Sometimes,
                            it is a lot easier to see what is happening in a
                            recursive function by drawing a diagram:
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <img
                              style="
                                margin: 10px auto;
                                vertical-align: middle;
                                display: block;
                              "
                              src="images/07ee848e-815a-4f94-88d8-d30002f4e6c0recurse.GIF"
                              alt="recurse"
                            />
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Recursion takes most people some time to get their
                            brains around so don't worry if you don't understand
                            it first time. Keep working at it and practising
                            different problems and eventually, it will click!
