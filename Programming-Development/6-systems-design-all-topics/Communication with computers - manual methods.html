                              keyboards. These devices can be used to enter in
                              data manually. They are very efficient in the
                              right hands but not so efficient if a user has
                              limited training. In fact, they can be very slow
                              and mistakes are easy to make, although software
                              tools can automatically fix many of them. A lot of
                              work has been done to ensure that keyboards are
                              designed 'ergonomically'. This means that they are
                              designed in a way that takes into account the
                              'design limitations' of a human being. There is a
                              health and safety problem known as Repetitive
                              Strain Injury (RSI) for people who use keyboards
                              all the time, such as secretaries. The joints in
                              their fingers can become 'worn'.</span

                              switch, which completes an electrical cicuit. When
                              the keyboard's processor detects this, it works
                              out what key has been pressed by comparing the
                              circuit that has been completed with a table of
                              character keys kept in its Read Only Memory. It
                              can also detect special combinations of keys
                              pressed, such as SHIFT G being a capital G. When
                              it has worked out the key or special combination,
                              it then sends this information to the

                              computer systems using keyboards is to use
                              touch-sensitive keyboards and concept keyboards.
                              These types of keyboard have 'keys' which are made
                              up of touch-sensitive areas on a plastic cover. A
                              user presses on the touch-sensitive area to input
                              data into the computer. They have a wide range of
                              applications. They can be used in fast food
                              restaurants. Operators simply press on pictures on
                              the keyboard. This speeds up data input and means
                              that training needs are minimal. They can be used
                              in areas where there is likely to be a lot of dirt
                              such as in factories. Dirt can get into normal
                              QWERTY keyboards and cause them to malfunction but
                              the protective plastic cover on touch-sensitive
                              keyboards stops this happening. They can be used
                              to customise keyboards because some
                              touch-sensitive keyboards (called 'concept
                              keyboards') allow you to program what you want to
                              happen when an area is pressed. You can imagine,
                              for example, designing a concept keyboard for a
                              two year old child, who may have limited
                              co-ordination and cannot yet read. You could
                              provide a keyboard with four big brightly coloured
                              areas. When the child wants to make any selection
                              at all, they just need to touch the right coloured
                              area.</span

                              touch screen enables a user to touch their VDU
                              screen to make selections. A plastic cover that
                              has fine wires running through it can be placed
                              over a VDU's screen. A user makes a selection by
                              touching the screen with their finger. The exact
                              position can be calculated from the signals sent
                              back by the wires. Touch screens allow very fast
                              selections from choices. They could be used in
                              places where people need to find out information
                              but may have zero computer skills, for example, an
                              information system in a library or a museum. They
                              would be of limited use if you had to type in a

                            >When you speak or play music into a microphone, the
                            microphone takes the sound waves and converts them
                            into a voltage. As the sound waves vary, so the
                            voltage varies. The microphone is connected to a
                            computer's sound card. The sound card samples the
                            microphone's voltage at intervals. How many times it
                            does this in a second is known as the 'sample rate'.
                            The time between samples is the 'sample interval'.
                            The bigger the gap between taking a sample, (in
                            other words the larger the sample interval), the
                            lower the quality of the recording, although the
                            benefit is a smaller file size. Each time the
                            voltage is sampled, it is converted into a binary
                            number by the sound card's Analogue to Digital
                            Converter (ADC) and stored. If you store all of the
                            digital samples, you end up with a sound file. This
                            might be a song or a recording of your voice, for
                            example.

                            which the speakers are connected. The Digital to
                            Analogue Converter (DAC) on the sound card takes the

                              is not perfect. You often have to teach it to
                              recognise your voice accurately. If you have a
                              cold or a throat problem, or a very strong accent,
                              it may reduce the accuracy of input. Nevertheless,

                              hardware that is plugged into an expansion slot
                              inside the computer. A user then attaches a video

                                  The amount of memory is a very important
                                  consideration with these cameras, as is the
                                  ability of a camera to add memory. This is
                                  because storing images is memory-intensive.

                                  Cameras often allow the user to select between
                                  high resolution and low resolution modes. If
                                  you use a high resolution mode, you will be
                                  able to take fewer pictures than low
                                  resolution mode.

                              cameras that store moving images. There is a wide
                              range of types of camera. Some camcorders store
                              the moving images as analogue signals. You may
                              have heard of VHS, Super VHS or 8mm analogue
                              camcorders. Analogue camcorder films lack really
                              mint quality and lose quality if they are copied.
                              Films made using digital camcorders, on the other
                              hand, have much better quality and don't lose any
                              quality if they are reproduced. This is because
                              the films are stored digitally.&nbsp;</span

                              biometrics. This means using a unique part of your
                              body to identify you. Typical examples include
                              fingerprint scanning in canteens, libraries,
                              phones and ATMS, retinal scanning for access to

                              and removes security issues. There are concerns
                              about what happens to the data, how it is stored
                              and who has access to it, however, and the
                              ever-present problem of hackers stealing your data
