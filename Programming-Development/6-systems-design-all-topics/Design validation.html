                            where we are designing it for others to use, we need
                            to check carefully that it really is fit for
                            purpose.

                            culture, ethics and way of doing things. Although
                            designers of systems in general and user interfaces
                            in particular always like to think they know best
                            and can design things for others to use, that rarely

                            <strong>Design reviews</strong><br />Designs must
                            always be checked and checked regularly. They can be
                            checked before a product is built in a number of
                            ways.

                                  covered all the points in a specification.

                                  critical eye over it and give feedback.

                                  This can be achieved by creating a mock-up of
                                  the design or a prototype, as customers may
                                  not be technical and may have trouble
                                  visualising a design as easily as the
                                  designers can.

                            <strong>Prototypes</strong><br />It is always a good
                            idea to create a prototype before investing a lot of
                            time and energy on the actual final product. It is a
                            quick and easy way to show others what you are
                            planning to do and get feedback. It is a great way
                            to check that you have understood what you have been
                            told. It is a really good way of others spotting
                            quickly that something is not quite right and needs
                            to be modified or that something has been missed out
                            and needs to be included or has been added but isn't
                            necessary. Other people may not have the same
                            expertise as you. By presenting something that looks
                            like the final product, even if it is far from
                            functional, you are including everyone in the review
                            process, whatever their background. Prototypes also
                            help to reassure the customer that they are going to
                            get what they need and are paying for and is a good
                            way of ensuring excellent on-going relationships
                            between the customer and supplier.&nbsp;

                            <strong>Checking the user interface</strong
                            ><br />One area that needs special consideration is
                            the user interface. Is it fit for purpose? How do
                            you know? Something may look perfect on paper but
                            just doesn't work as well in practice. How can you
                            prove it works well? It is important to check with
                            all relevant stakeholders that the user interface is
                            fit for purpose. Again, prototypes can help here,
                            but ultimately, the final product's interface must
                            be tested. That means sitting down with users,
                            devising a set of tasks and seeing how they get on.
                            It means providing a way of getting feedback from
                            your users and then listening carefully to your
                            users when they spend time giving you feedback,
                            taking action wherever possible and explaining to
                            them when something can't be done about a concern.
                            There are various tests, tasks and questions that
                            can be worked through when sitting down with users
                            and asking them for feedback. For example,&nbsp;
