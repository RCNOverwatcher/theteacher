                          <p>
                            <strong>Programming errors</strong><br />When a
                            programmer writes a program, errors are sometimes
                            made in the code. Finding errors, or ‘bugs’, in a
                            program is known as ‘debugging’ a program. Errors
                            can be classified under the three headings.
                          </p>
                          <ol>
                            <li style="list-style-type: none">
                              <ol>
                                <li>Syntax errors.</li>
                                <li>Logical errors.</li>
                                <li>Run-time errors.</li>
                              </ol>
                            </li>
                          </ol>
                          <p>
                            These classifications come about because the first
                            type of error should be picked up by your
                            translator's diagnostics. In other words, when you
                            try to translate your program from source code to
                            object code. The second type of error can be
                            translated successfully and won't actually cause
                            your computer to display an error at all. It's up to
                            the programmer to find these. The third type of
                            error again can be translated but this time will
                            throw up an error when the object code is run.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <strong>1. Syntax errors</strong><br />Every program
                            has its own set of rules regarding the instructions
                            that can be used and the way that each instruction
                            must be constructed. If a programmer were to break
                            one of those rules, the program would not be
                            translatable into object code. For example, look at
                            the following Python program:
                          </p>
                          <p style="margin-left: 30px">
                            <strong>Print(“Hello world”)</strong>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If we tried to translate this program into object
                            code, our translator program would diagnose a syntax
                            error because the rules of Python haven't been
                            strictly followed. The keyword Print starts with a
                            capital letter. Python’s keywords are case
                            sensitive. Print should have started with a small
                            letter p.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <strong>2. Logical errors</strong><br />When a
                            programmer has written a program that contains
                            logical errors, it can be translated and run.
                            However, the program will produce incorrect results
                            or displays. For example, suppose you had a program
                            line that multiplied two numbers:
                          </p>
                          <p style="margin-left: 30px">
                            <strong>Result = valueA + valueB</strong>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            This would be translated into object code correctly.
                            When the executable code is run, however, it would
                            produce an incorrect result. This is because the +
                            was used instead of the multiplication symbol. It is
                            up to the programmer to discover these types of bugs
                            by writing a very good test plan to pick them up. If
                            the test plan isn't comprehensive, then the
                            programmer will think that they have written a good
                            program but it will be flawed!
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <strong
                              >3. Run-time errors and arithmetic errors</strong
                            ><br />As with logical errors, a program with these
                            types of errors can be translated without an error
                            being discovered. Unlike logical errors, however,
                            the program will stop running and a run-time error
                            will be displayed. A typical example of a run-time
                            error is when a division by zero occurs in a
                            calculation. Dividing by zero is a meaningless
                            calculation. Impossible arithmetic operations that
                            result in errors are also called arithmetic errors.
                            Another run-time error would occur when a program
                            has run out of memory. There is a fixed amount of
                            RAM in any computer. Some of it will be used for the
                            operating system and the rest will be used for
                            applications and data files currently needed by the
                            CPU. If the CPU can’t run a program because there is
                            not enough memory available to store temporary
                            values, for example, then it will display a run-time
                            error message and stop working.
