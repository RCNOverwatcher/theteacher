                            As computers have become more widespread, so the
                            need for legislation has grown. There now exists
                            legislation that seeks to protect our health and
                            safety while working with computers, to protect our
                            privacy, to ensure that those who seek to carry out
                            criminal acts using computer technology are punished
                            and to ensure that intellectual rights to material
                            are protected. One major problem with any country's
                            legislation, however, is that it is difficult to
                            enforce those laws if the 'crime' is carried out in
                            another country. The Internet is a worldwide
                            phenomenon that crosses the boundary of every
                            country. What is illegal in one country may be
                            perfectly legal in another country, or may simply be
                            impossible to enforce. There are lots of good
                            sources that deal with this issue on the Internet.

                            ><br />Organisations collect data and store
                            information about individuals. It is important,
                            however, for each organisation to recognise that the
                            information collected about an individual is private
                            and that the individual has a right to expect that
                            it stays private. Each organisation should only
                            collect the information that it actually needs and
                            should be up-front about what it needs it for. The
                            DPA 1998 was an extension of the DPA 1984. It bought
                            the 1984 Act up-to-date with European legislation
                            and also included extra safeguards, such as
                            including data sent over the Internet.

                            <strong>Some disadvantages of the DPA</strong
                            ><br />While most people would agree that the
                            legislation is useful, there are some drawbacks.
                            Some people would argue that while it sounds good in
                            practice, it is very difficult to enforce. For
                            example, if you are running a small club and store
                            members' details on the computer, you are supposed
                            to be registered - but how many are? The DPA
                            legislation means extra administration and expense
                            for an organisation. For example, somebody has to be
                            responsible and take the time to ensure that data is
                            kept accurate and up-to-date. Somebody has to
                            administer the system that allows somebody to see
                            their details. Somebody has to be responsible for
                            making sure a company follows the DPA. Whenever
                            somebody has to do something, it involves that
                            person being away from the core activities of the
                            organisation and involves an expense for the
                            company. Some might argue that the last principle of
                            the Act described above is impossible and
                            impractical to enforce. How can you monitor who
                            accesses data from an online database via a web site
                            from another country? How can you enforce
                            regulations? Conviction rates are low.

                            ><br />We have already said that there is a problem
                            when one country tries to impose its values and laws
                            on people in other countries. One approach is to
                            have legislation that crosses national boundaries.
                            Directive 95/46/EC is European legislation that lays
                            down rules designed to protect the rights and
                            privacy of individuals with regard to data kept
                            about them across Europe. Directive 97/66/EC is
                            another piece of legislation concerned with
                            provisions for data privacy and protection in the
                            telecom industry.

                            ><br />The EU's "e-Privacy" Directive from 2002, was
                            amended in 2009. All E.U. member states had to bring
                            the Directive into their own law by 2011. The U.K.'s
                            amended Privacy and Electronic Communication
                            Regulations (PECR) Act 2011 became law on May 26,
                            2011. The law stated, amongst other things, that
                            companies operating in the E.U. and the U.K. must
                            get the consent from its website users for cookies.
                            Cookies are small programs that get installed on
                            your computer when you visit a particular website.
                            They allow websites to offer a more personalised
                            experience, such as remembering a user's preferences
                            and they allow a website owner to track how often
                            their pages are being visited. Cookies can, however,
                            also be used to track a user’s online behaviour and
                            other ‘interesting’ personal information.

                              Internet</strong
                            ><br />One country's laws and values are not
                            necessarily another country's laws and values. If
                            one country decides that hard-core pornography is
                            perfectly legal to show and sell and their citizens
                            put web sites on the Internet, how can another
                            country like the UK stop people viewing this kind of
                            material, even though it is against the law in the
                            UK? The answer is that it can't. Nobody owns or runs
                            the Internet so it is very difficult for anyone to
                            have control over it. We live in a democracy and we
                            expect freedom of expression and to a large degree
                            freedom of information. Most citizens, however,
                            accept that there are times when there is a
                            'national security' argument for having some
                            information restricted. Before the Internet, each
                            country could decide exactly what their nationals
                            could have access to. Post Internet, however, the
                            situation has completely changed. It is very easy to
                            set up anonymous web sites that have all kinds of
                            controversial material on including pornography, how
                            to make a nuclear bomb and libellous gossip. This
                            information crosses every boundary. It is difficult
                            to convict anyone of anything anymore!
