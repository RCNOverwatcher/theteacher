<h1 style="text-align: center;">Agile methodologies and Extreme Programming (XP)</h1>
<p><strong>Agile methodologies</strong><br>Agile software development is a different approach compared to the traditional waterfall model. This methodology is characterised by concentrating on the people, working groups, communication, getting the software to work and responding to events quickly and effectively. A 'manifesto' for the Agile methodology states:&nbsp;</p>
 
<p><strong>"We are uncovering better ways of developing&nbsp;software by doing it and helping others do it.&nbsp;Through this work we have come to value:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Individuals and interactions&nbsp;over processes and tools</strong></li>
<li><strong>Working software&nbsp;over comprehensive documentation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Customer collaboration&nbsp;over contract negotiation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Responding to change&nbsp;over following a plan."</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All Agile methodologies work in an iterative way (going around and around, releasing a new, small piece of software each time, until you get to where you need to be). These methodologies aim for an incremental delivery of working software in short periods of time. After each small release of software, many activities take place at once, including requirements specifications, producing code and testing. Each software release typically occurs after a fixed time length (which varies between the methodologies) and are therefore referred to as '<strong>time-boxed</strong>'. The time given to each iteration, each release of software, is also referred to as a '<strong>cycle time</strong>' or a '<strong>sprint</strong>'. Another piece of jargon associated with Agile Methodologies is '<strong>ceremony</strong>'. If a methodology has lots of different steps and lots of different deliverables and lots of people involved in signing off each stage, then the methodology is known as a 'higher ceremony' one. If there are few steps, products and people involved, then it's a 'lower ceremony' methodology.</p>
<p><strong>Extreme Programming (XP)</strong><br>There are a number of Agile methodologies being used today. One of the most popular ones is called Extreme Programming (XP) but there are others, including Scrum, Feature Driven Development (FDD), Lean Software Development, Agile Unified Process (Agile UP or AUP) and Crystal.&nbsp;XP focusses on promotes getting the technical and&nbsp;practical considerations correct so that programmers can deliver small chunks of working software.</p>
<p>XP has four core values: Simplicity, Communication, Feedback and Courage! From these core values, thirteen specific practises have been identified:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"><ol>
<li>Work on one thing at a time, incrementally.</li>
<li>Release as many small releases as possible, as quickly as possible, to get as much feedback as possible.</li>
<li>Use metaphors in documentation e.g. the Shopping Cart' is often used as a metaphor for the online shopping experience.</li>
<li>Always use the simplest design to get the function working. Don't add things that may not be used.</li>
<li>Test everything. Use automatic testing if possible.</li>
<li>Design as you go, making improvements when you need to.</li>
<li>Program in pairs or small groups, to allow discussions about requirements, designs, coding, testing etc.</li>
<li>Anyone on the team can make a change to code at any time - everyone owns the code.</li>
<li>The entire product is constantly being tested as new parts are added.</li>
<li>The teams should not be stressed out when they work, trying to meet unrealistic deadlines by working late and weekends and not seeing their families, for example.</li>
<li>Everyone in the team should aim to be able to do anything that needs doing; generalisation rather than specialisation of team members.</li>
<li>Everyone in the team should know and follow whatever standards are agreed.</li>
<li>Aim for constant and direct customer access, to facilitate feedback and general communications.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">These thirteen practises are all interelated so they should ideally all be in any project.</p>
<p>XP is different to other Agile Methodologies in that it has an iteration time of from one to four weeks for each production of software. It is also a very low ceremony methodology, typically producing plans involving storyboarding, small units of code and correspondingly small test plans for each unit of code. Storyboarding simply means breaking down what the user wants into small notes on a card. Once the story has been told on cards, the cards can be prioritised. The programmers can then work out how long it will take to do the work on each card in the order required and this can be used to track the progress of the project. As the work progresses, the amount of time being taken for each card can be monitored and adjustments made.</p>
<p>There are a number of key roles in any XP project. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>the Customer, who will create and prioritise the stories that need to be told</li>
<li>the Programmers, who produce the code and take responsibility for tracking the time the job takes and the testing of the work produced</li>
<li>the Coach, who oversees the whole project, helps programmers and highlights potential issues</li>
<li>the Tracker, who is responsible for tracking the time the project and tasks are taking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
