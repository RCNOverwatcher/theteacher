<h1 style="text-align: center;">Systems analysis documentation</h1>
<p><strong>What documentation should be produced and when for a typical project?&nbsp;</strong><br>The key stages of any project following a traditional waterfall model are shown below.</p>
<p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="images/a70b3962-9abc-4ad6-9f39-f74ae8cb6a2esys1.gif" alt="waterfall model"></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">You can never define exactly what documentation should be produced at every stage of a project life cycle as it will differ from project to project.&nbsp;</span>However, there are key pieces of documentation that appear again and again in every project. Note that there are unlikely to be any key documents produced in the implementation and installation stages, and that some waterfall models show the last stage as 'Documentation'. Since this section is about documentation, we have changed the 'Maintenance' stage to talk more generally about the user and technical documentation guides.</p>

<td>This is the key document for this stage. It will typically describe in general terms two or three potential options for solving the problem area. It will describe the implications for each solution, time scales, cost-benefits, total costs, any legal, employment, social, training, moral or ethical issues. This document is given to the customer to help them decide how to proceed.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Systems analysis</strong></td>
<td align="left" valign="top">Requirements specification<br><br>but also possibly the following:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Written descriptions<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dataflow diagrams<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Systems flowcharts<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Jackson diagrams<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Data dictionaries<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Current hardware<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Current software<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Training needs<br><br></td>
<td align="left" valign="top">The key document in this section is the Requirements Specification. This clearly and unambiguously spells out what the solution must be able to do and how success of each item in the Requirements Specification will be measured at the end of the project, to judge whether it has been met or not.
<p>A lot of information is gathered when doing the Systems Analysis, especially if you are investigating an existing system. You will be doing interviews, collecting documents, observing people and so on. To help make sense of this vast collection of facts and opinions, lots of documents may be produced to help you work towards producing the Requirements Specification.</p>

<td align="left" valign="top">In the design section, you will unambiguously 
describe the solution you are going to implement. This means that you will probably start by describing in written English what you are proposing but then use dataflow diagrams and systems flowcharts to describe exactly how information will move around your solution. You will draw out an overview of all the different screens a user will use and the navigation between them as well as draw up designs for queries and reports and any other output. You will describe programs using Jackson Structured Program, flowcharts and pseudo-code. You will describe the data that is going to be used, including validation rules and verification procedures and you will fully describe the structures you will use and how they will be accessed. You will describe any file systems and input / output access. You will also need to calculate the volumes of data your solution can expect. Flowcharts and pseudo-code will be used to describe algorithms and specific functions and you will need to describe what libraries you intend to use and where they will come from. It is also in this stage that you should draw up complete test plans at least for black box testing for testing the Requirements Specification and the user and acceptance test procedures you will use and the data that will be used. You may also include some other test procedures and data, for example, white box testing, alpha and beta testing. Care should be taken to state the test, the data that will be used, why that data was selected and the expected result, ready for the test to be carried out.</td>

<td align="left" valign="top">The results of all test should be kept here. They may used to inform necessary changes. They may need to be referred to if there is a problem later on. They may need to be redone if maintenance in the future is carried out. The customer may want to see them, to prove the system is working.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Documentation</strong></td>
<td align="left" valign="top">User documentation<br>Technical documentation</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">The user documentation is a guide for actual users of the system. It should be as free from jargon as possible and written in plain English suitable for the target audience. It may be a written document in booklet or pdf form, an on-screen interactive guide or an Internet web site. It gives the user everything they need to use the system. The user documentation may include a contents page and search facility, the hardware and software needed to run the software, a getting started guide, licence information, other legal information, how-to descriptions including screendumps, walk-through guides and videos, how to get further help, email and phone contact information, how to report errors information, jargon explanations and any other relevant information.
<p>The Technical guide is written for technical experts, who may have to modify the system in the future when you are no longer there. It should include all of the technical documentation produced in the design stage as well as the test plans and the results of tests carried out. It should also include complete annotated program listings with full documentation.</p>
