<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Spiral Model</h1>
<p>Another approach to developing projects and especially software products is known as the Spiral Model. Like Rapid Application Development, it involves an 'iterative' process. This simply means that you keep repeating the same set of tasks, but each time you do this, you get a little bit closer to the final product. Eventually, the product will be completed.</p>
 
<p>You start in the centre of the spiral. As you go round the spiral, you go through the four key regions that make up the model. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Planning - you work out the objectives for the next iteration.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Risk Analysis - you identify any problems you might face and draw up an action plan.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Designing, Developing and Testing - produce and test the product for this iteration.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Evaluate what you have just done and plan for the next circuit in the spiral.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that with this model, Risk Analysis is a very important part of the development process. Each time a circuit is completed, the risks to the project are specifically analysed to try to minimise the problems that might happen in the future. (Large software projects especially, are notoriously difficult to keep on time and budget.)</p>
