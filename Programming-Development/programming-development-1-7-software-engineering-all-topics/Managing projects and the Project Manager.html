<h1 style="text-align: center;">Managing projects and the Project Manager</h1>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>There are three main aims of any project. They are easier to state than achieve!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">1) The project must satisfy the requirements of the customer.<br>2) The project must be done within the budget allowed for the project.<br>3) The project must be completed within the agreed timescales.</p>
 
<p><strong>Problems with projects</strong><br>There are often a lot of people working on a project. Projects themselves can be highly complex. Because of these facts, passing information around and ensuring that people get the information they need can be a problem, especially if written documentation is incomplete, not up-to-date or non-existent. This could happen when workers are pressured into completing jobs rather than the paperwork. It could happen if people do not follow procedures when they change something in a project. Communication between different people in projects can be a problem. It can be difficult to get different people to agree to parts of the project. For example, the Project Manager must agree with the customer EXACTLY what the requirements of the project are and must agree with the customer EXACTLY how it will be decided if a requirement has been met or not. The customer may want a system that is ‘user-friendly’. How will ‘user-friendliness’ be measured? What happens at the end of the project if the Project Manager thinks they have built a user-friendly interface but the customer finds it difficult to use? It is a very difficult user requirement to include in a specification. The poor specification of user requirements is one area that can cause problems as well producing requirements for sub-contractors. There is a lot of pressure on people by management to get a project finished on time. Employees are often pressured to start on a task before the task-preparation has been completed. Complex projects are difficult to plan, manage and control. For example, it is difficult to estimate appropriate amounts of time and resources to projects. Because of this, projects can overrun their deadlines and their budget. There are a lot of complex regulations and laws that must be taken into account when building any project. There can be problems if they are not all fully known about, understood and adhered to. However good the skills of a Project Manager, they will find it difficult to plan for random events such as strikes, war, fire or personality clashes, for example. One of the valued personal qualities of a Project Manager is their ability to deal with new situations as they arise and to be able to adapt the project to them.</p>
<p><strong>Why project management is important and the role of the Project Manager</strong><br>Project management should result in a complex project being split up into stages. The Project Manager can therefore 'see' the project more clearly and can see more clearly what has to be done and by when. This may well be aided by the production of Gantt charts or Critical Path Analysis diagrams. Breaking a project down allows the Project Manager to more accurately allocate resources to tasks. Resources include people's time, contractors and access to a particular piece of equipment, for example. In addition, it is easier to allocate a budget to lots of little stages rather than one big project. Project management should allow the progress of a project to be 'measured'. Each stage will have associated with it 'deliverables' and 'milestones'. Deliverables are the actual jobs or documentation that must be completed whilst milestones are the actual dates by when certain things must be done. At key dates, the Project Manager can review the milestones and deliverables and take appropriate action if a job has slipped behind. Project management involves laying down rules and procedures for employees on the project to follow. If there is a change to a design, for example, the procedures will ensure that everyone knows who needs to be told and what must be done. In short, it instils discipline and predictability into a project. Project management ensures that health and safety issues are considered before tasks are carried out. Good project management ensures that project documentation is complete and up-to-date. This might be important, for example, if employees leave their job and someone else has to take over. It will be very important if the Project Manager leaves!</p>
