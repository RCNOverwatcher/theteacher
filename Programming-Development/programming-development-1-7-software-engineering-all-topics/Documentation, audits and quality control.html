<h1 style="text-align: center;">Documentation, audits and quality control</h1>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Documentation</strong><br></span>In any project life cycle, documentation is important. We have already said that if the documentation for a project is not accurate and complete, then all kinds of problems can occur. In addition, it should be pointed out that all projects should have&nbsp;fixed procedures for dealing with modifications that have been requested or errors that have been discovered. These are known as ‘change control procedures’. It is a set of formal documents that must be filled in for each change that occurs for any reason.&nbsp;It ensures that every place in the project documentation the change can influence has been revisited and modified appropriately. It also ensures that all the people who need to know about the change are informed. Any project methodology&nbsp;will include places where formal reviews take place. This forms an important part of documentation as proof is needed that reviews have indeed taken place. Reviews may take the form of meetings with the customer to discuss the user Interface, for&nbsp;example, or they could be project meetings with the system designers to examine and sign off deliverables for a project stage.</p>
<p><strong>Software and hardware audit</strong><br>If a project uses software and/or hardware then it is important to keep track of what has been installed. In particular, records should be kept about the version of any software being used and the technical specification of any hardware. This information&nbsp;will be needed if any future modifications to a system are made or if some hardware needs to be returned under warranty. There should be formal procedures to ensure that this information is complete and accurate, with a named person responsible for the ensuring the procedures are followed. Any software bought should be backed-up in case the original media gets&nbsp;damaged. The software needs to be stored in an appropriately secure place, perhaps a fire safe and the licences should be carefully filed and documented. Free access to the software should not be allowed because if people copy the software for their own machines then the company will be breaking the copyright laws and could have legal action taken against them.</p>
<p><strong>Quality control and management</strong><br>Only through the use of methodologies and correct documentation can a project progress to a high standard. Documentation can too easily be side-stepped (with the genuine intention of completing it later). All too often, however, that can cause great&nbsp;problems. People soon forget what they did, what they agreed to do, what changes they made or what someone told them they wanted, for example. Word soon gets around about a company's reputation. It is the job of management to ensure that all the procedures are followed, although this may well conflict with their other main role - to get jobs finished!&nbsp;</p>
