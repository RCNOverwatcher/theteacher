                            ><br />Programmers write many algorithms. What they
                            always should do is to ask themselves how 'good' an
                            algorithm they have just written is. Big O notation
                            is used to describe the performance of an algorithm
                            and in particular, how it performs as the amount of
                            data given to it increases,

                            >&nbsp;For example, how would an algorithm perform
                            if it were given an array of 10 numbers to work with
                            compared to an array with 100000 numbers in? Big O
                            always looks for the worst case scenario. For
                            example, if you had an algorithm that did a serial
                            search through an array of 500 items, it would
                            always assume that you find the item on the 500<sup

                            >
                            search, or that the item didn't exist at all.

                            ><br />Although you can measure how
                            <strong><em>fast</em> </strong>an algorithm goes
                            using a program, it would be dependent on the
                            hardware. For example, if an algorithm takes 0.0004
                            seconds to run on one machine, will it run faster on
                            a computer with a faster processor? Timing an
                            algorithm tells you about the computer hardware
                            rather than the software. It is impossible to time
                            an algorithm for all configurations of computers but
                            what we can do is to evaluate the
                            <strong><em>performance</em> </strong>of an
                            algorithm, and we can do this using Big O notation.

                          <p>
                            <strong>An example of Big O notation</strong
                            ><br />Consider the following simplified equation as
                            an example:
                          </p>
                          <p>56n<sup>3</sup> + 20n<sup>2</sup> + 17</p>
                          <p>
                            Using Big O notation, we can define the part of the
                            equation that has the greatest effect on the
                            answer.&nbsp;
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If n = 1, the answer is 93 and all parts of the
                            equation have an impact on the final answer.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If n = 2 (just one more value), then the answer is
                            321. The 17 at the end of the equation is actually
                            not very significant. It doesn't really have much
                            impact on the final answer.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If n = 10, the answer is 58017 and the 17 really is
                            pretty insignificant now. Also, however, the 20n<sup
                              >2</sup
                            >
                            term is not that significant. It only contributed
                            2000 to the final answer.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            In fact, the term that has the most impact on the
                            final answer when n becomes large, is the 56n<sup
                              >3</sup
                            >
                            term. And even here, the term that has the most
                            impact for larger numbers isn't the 56 part of the
                            term but the n<sup>3</sup> term.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            We therefore say that this equation has an order of
                            n cubed, and in Big O notation,
                          </p>
                          <p><strong>O(N<sup>3</sup>)</strong></p>
                          <p>
                            This is the idea behind Big O notation. We are using
                            it to describe how well algorithms perform.
