<h1 style="text-align: center;">Backing up and recovering data</h1>
<p><strong class="NormalContentHeading">Backing up and recovering data</strong><br><span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">If an organisation's network or key pieces of hardware fail for whatever reason, it might have serious implications for the organisation. They would lose all of their employees' records. They would lose all of the data about the products they sell. They wouldn't know who has paid them for products and services and who still owes them money, and they wouldn't know what bills need to be paid. They would lose all the information about past and present customers and all the information about marketing and advertising. Losing data could be so serious that they might even go out of business. If some of the network hardware failed on your school or college network, you might lose all of your controlled assessments or other project work. The school might lose all of its information it needs to run the school and information about you, for example, contact information in case you have an accident. The data must be kept secure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px; line-height: 16.3636360168457px;"><strong>A backup policy</strong><br>An organisation needs to implement a backup strategy so that if data is lost, the activities of the organisation aren't compromised. A sensible organisation will have a backup policy written down so that if a serious problem happens, everyone will know exactly what to do. There will be less panic and fewer hasty decisions made if the company thinks through what might happen and what should be done if a problem actually occurs well in advance of a problem actually happening. The policy should deal with the following things:</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"></span></p>
<ul style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">
<li style="line-height: 20px; list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The hardware/software that will be used to backup a system.</li>
<li>The person responsible for backups.</li>
<li>The frequency that backups will be done.</li>
<li>When they will be done.</li>
<li>Where backup copies will be kept.</li>
<li>How backup copies will be labelled.</li>
<li>How the company will know the backup system is working as it should, how it will be tested and how often.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">A backup system needs to use media that is big enough to hold all the data to be backed-up! Magnetic tape is often used for backing-up networks because gigabytes of data can be stored on them. Servers often have a special piece of hardware in them that holds a number of magnetic tapes. The software that comes with it can be configured to automatically backup data in the middle of the night and eject the tape ready for the network manager to put in the fire safe first thing in the morning.&nbsp;Backing-up networks to cloud storage is also increasingly common. Files are stored off-site, with many different versions being stored going back in time. The cloud storage company takes responsibility for the safe storage of data, ensuring it is protected from hackers or viruses, for example. Of course, you need a reliable Internet connection for this system to work.&nbsp;USB pen drives, CD R/W or cloud storage are all useful backup storage media to use for personal, day-to-day files.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">Backups need to be done, or at least managed, by a named person so that everyone is clear whose job it is to do what and whose job it is to check that the system is working as it should. A backup file quickly becomes out-of-date because the actual system is constantly changing. Therefore, backups need to be taken frequently enough to ensure that only a very limited amount of data is lost. Because a 'rolling program' of backup copies will most likely be made, it is important that everyone is clear how these will be labelled and where they will be kept. Will a copy be kept in a fire safe or off-site, for example? If off-site, how often will it be changed and who will do it? It is very easy for this kind of system not to be done properly because backup copies are rarely needed. Systems generally run smoothly. The problem comes when there is a problem!</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>System images, incremental back-ups and scheduling</strong><br>Operating systems usually come with utility programs to allow you to take back-ups. Typical options include the ability to take an entire 'snapshot' of your hard drive (called a 'system image') so that if your hard drive fails, you simply replace it, and then run a recovery program on a pen drive or CD that loads the system image onto your new hard drive. Another option is to schedule back-ups so that back-ups happen automatically at a particular time of day. You can also tell your computer to do a full back-up (all of your data files), only back-up files that have been added or altered since the last time you did a back-up (called an 'incremental back-up') or only back-up files from certain folders. Most people used to back-up to an external hard drive but it is becoming more common to back-up to cloud storage now.</span></p>
<p>The last point about back-ups to make is that an untested back-up should not be depended upon. You should periodically test files being backed up to see if the process has been working correctly. Unfortunately, some people do not do this and find out that their system has not been backing things up correctly only when their hard drive fails! This can be a disaster, of course.</p>
<p style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;"><strong><img style="margin: 20px; float: right;" src="images/75044a9b-d09c-448a-a3e5-f2e892c38922Failsafe.GIF" alt="Failsafe">Disk mirroring strategies and failover<br></strong>All equipment will fail eventually. Moving parts wear out. Dust gets into equipment and stops them working properly. There are other reasons, too. So that a business can continue as normal in the event of a serious hardware failure, organisations often use 'failover'. Failover is the term used when you have a second, identical piece of equipment that can start working automatically if the first main piece of equipment fails.</p>
<p style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">For example, one key piece of equipment on a client-server network is the server. This manages the entire network of personal computers, printers and other hardware on the network. If the server fails, the whole network will not be available for anyone to use.</p>
<p style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">Network designers often include a second, back-up server on a network. This second server has a mirror image of the software and files on the main server, and is constantly updated. If the main server fails, then this second server starts up automatically so that users on the network can carry on as normal. They wonâ€™t even know that there has been a major hardware problem. The network manager can then arrange to get the main server fixed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">You could ask your Network Manager if they have a back-up server that kicks in automatically in case the first one fails. You could also ask about the back-up system in place. Are magnetic tapes used? How is the back-up system organised? How often are back-ups taken? Have they considered using cloud storage for automatic back-ups if they don't? Why do they / don't they use cloud storage?&nbsp;</p>
