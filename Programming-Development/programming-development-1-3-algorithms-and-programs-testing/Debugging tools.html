                            Once an error in a program has been discovered,
                            whether it is a syntax error, a logical error or a
                            run-time error, whether it has been discovered
                            during white box testing, black box testing, alpha
                            testing or beta testing, the program needs to be
                            debugged! This can sometimes be easier said than
                            done. Fortunately, there are tools to help!
                            Programming languages usually come with debugging
                            programs. These are software tools for the
                            programmer to use to help find bugs. Make sure you
                            know how to use at least some of these with whatever
                            programming language you are learning. your teacher
                            should help you with this.

                            ><br />
                            When some source code is translated, what actually
                            happens is that the source code is passed over to a
                            program called a 'translator'. The translator checks
                            each line in turn against the rules of the language.
                            You will know from experience that programming
                            instructions using keywords must be written in
                            exactly the correct way. If there is any deviation
                            from the rules in the way an instruction is
                            constructed then an error will be reported. This is
                            known as a syntax error. An appropriate error
                            message would be displayed on the screen and the
                            location of the error in the program would be
                            highlighted. Unfortunately, the exact position of
                            the error is not always obvious from the information
                            given by the translator diagnostics program and the
                            error messages given can be rather cryptic
                            sometimes. Translator diagnostics do, however, help
                            a programmer locate syntax errors in a program.

                              ><strong>Watch and trace</strong><br />It is
                              possible for a programmer to tell the computer to
                              display (or 'watch') certain variables in a
                              program. The programmer can then step through the
                              program line-by-line (or 'trace' through the
                              program) watching the variables as they change.
                              This is a little like doing a dry run on paper.
                              This tool, however, is very powerful when used
                              with the breakpoint tool described below.</span

                            Consider a program that has 10000 thousand of lines
                            of code. A programmer trying to track down a fault
                            is confident that the first 8000 lines are fine but
                            suspects the problem lies somewhere after line 8000.
                            They can set a 'breakpoint' at line 8000 and then
                            run the program. The program will run from the
                            beginning of the program right up to line 8000 and
                            will then stop. At that point, the programmer can
                            then examine the contents of the variables they have
                            told the computer to 'watch'. When they have done
                            that they will either have spotted the problem and
                            will set about correcting it or they will set the
                            program running to the next breakpoint. They could
                            also 'watch and trace' from that breakpoint.

                            This debugging tool identifies every place that a
                            particular variable occurs. This is useful, because
                            it allows the programmer to check that each variable
                            has been named correctly and that one variable name
                            hasn't been used for two different things.

                            When programs are designed using the top-down
                            approach, it means that a big problem is split up
                            into lots of smaller problems and a program, or
                            ‘module’, is then written for each problem. Each of
                            the modules produced should ideally perform one
                            task. When a program is being tested, the smaller
                            modules are each tested individually first. They are
                            then combined with other modules and they are tested
                            together. These are then combined with even more
                            modules, and tested, until the whole program has
                            effectively been rebuilt and completely tested.

                            easier to find faults in lots of smaller blocks of
                            code and then recombine them than trying to find
