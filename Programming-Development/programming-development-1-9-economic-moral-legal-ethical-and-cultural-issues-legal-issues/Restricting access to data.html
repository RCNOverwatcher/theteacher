                            <strong>Introduction</strong><br />There are number
                            of ways that access to data available on the
                            Interent and World wide Web can be restricted.

                              things are available to view with little effort.
                              The role of education is to discuss what can be
                              viewed and whether it should or shouldn't be
                              viewed, and the consequences of doing so.
                              Youngsters who view pornography, for example, can
                              develop very unhealthy views of the opposite sex
                              and the role of love and mutual respect in a
                              relationship. Viewing graphic violence at a young
                              age can be both&nbsp;</span

                              develop a moral compass and self-restraint may be
                              the most effective way of controlling access to
                              undesirable content.</span

                              ><br />Most organisations get users of their
                              network to sign an Acceptable Use Agreement. This
                              states clearly what a user is and isn't allowed to
                              do using the hardware and software that the
                              organisation owns and is responsible for. If
                              someone breaks this agreement, then there will be
                              no surprises about the sanctions that will be
                              applied. For an employee, this could mean losing
                              their job.</span

                              ><strong>Filters</strong><br />Many Internet
                              Service Providers (ISPs) now have controls
                              available to filter out certain kinds of material
                              from the Internet so that if someone tries to
                              search for something or view something they
                              shouldn't, it is blocked. This can involve
                              building and maintaining a list of banned sites (a
                              never-ending and almost impossible job), banning
                              keywords in search engines and articles, banning
                              certain kinds of files like music files from being
                              downloaded and banning websites that have a
                              particular rating. Some controls are switched on
                              by default. Others, parents have to switch on
                              themselves. Parents can also buy filtering
                              software, which allows even more customisation of
                              the kinds of material that will and won't be
                              allowed. Organisations such as schools usually
                              have a filtered Internet feed. This might, for
                              example, block eBay and YouTube and allows schools
                              to add extra sites to block as they want.</span

                              >Filtering is not fool-proof. Many parents know
                              little about setting filters up properly. Filters
                              are not 100% guaranteed and they are relatively
                              easy to circumvent using proxy
                              servers.&nbsp;</span

                              ><strong>Censorship by organisations</strong
                              ><br />YouTube and Twitter, for example, are
                              regularly asked to block access to material. This
                              may be from organisations and may be from
                              Governments. The problem with this is that what
                              might be legal in one country is illegal in
                              another so blocking has to be done just for
                              specific countries. Another problem is that of
                              free speech. China, for example, does not want
                              certain sites displaying information about
                              politically sensitive topics, like the Tiananmen
                              massacre. Whilst it might block sites with this
                              kind of information, it might inadvertently stop
                              access to sites that many Chinese now use for
                              business. Countries like India may try to block
                              e.g. India's Daughter from being shown in the
                              country because it shows the attitude of Indian
                              society in a bad light. This is not easy to do,
                              however, because anyone can view this film using a
                              proxy server, by using a peer-to-peer sharing
                              service and by having access to unregulated
                              satellite TV.</span
