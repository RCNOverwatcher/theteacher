                            A recursive routine is a routine that calls itself.
                            An iterative routine is one that loops the same code
                            a number of times, anything from never actually
                            doing the code to many times, depending on the
                            result of a condition or by using a FOR loop. We saw
                            some examples of iteration in 3.2.2d. Any recursive
                            function or procedure can be rewritten as an
                            iterative one. There are some key differences
                            between the approaches.

                                  If a recursive routine keeps calling itself,
                                  then it has to keep pushing values onto the
                                  stack, and ultimately keep taking them off (or
                                  'popping') values off the stack. The problem
                                  with this is that the stack is a fixed size,
                                  so too many calls and you will quickly fill up
                                  the stack and get a 'stack overflow' error.
                                  Also, it takes time to push and pop values on
                                  and off the stack. As long as there aren't too
                                  many recursive calls, then recursion is fast.
                                  Too many calls, and relative to iteration, the
                                  process becomes slow.

                                  You can see from the two examples above that
                                  there are less instructions using recursion.
                                  Less instructions means a smaller program,
                                  smaller object code and a program that should
                                  in theory run faster.

                                  however, and knowing how to trace a recursive
                                  routine, it does become fairly easy.
