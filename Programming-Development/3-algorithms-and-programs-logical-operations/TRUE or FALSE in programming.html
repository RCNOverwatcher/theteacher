                            <strong>Introduction</strong><br />Boolean algebra
                            is often used in programming. You frequently have to
                            test a value and if the result is TRUE then you run
                            one block of code but if it's FALSE, you run a
                            different block of code. This is called 'selection'
                            in programming. We write some pseudo-code to
                            represent using this selection construction using
                            the IF statement.

                            Most programming languages have an IF keyword so
                            that you can use the selection construction. The
                            actual syntax (the way the construction is written
                            and the keyowrds you must use) differs from language
                            to language but the idea is the same for all
                            languages. The tests use maths operators. These are
                            typically &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;=, == and !=.

                              the computer you are testing strings. There is a
                              big difference in programming between the number 5
                              and the symbol '5', for example, and this is often
                              a cause of bugs in a program when you start out
                              learning how to code. When comparing strings, your
                              computer converts each letter into its ASCII code
                              and compares those numbers! It's useful to have an
                              ASCII table handy.</span
