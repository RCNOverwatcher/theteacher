                            a function, the local variables inside the function
                            actually disappear completely, never to be seen

                                  to have exactly the same global variables in
                                  it as the original program, and they will have

                                  disappear as soon as you leave a function and
                                  the memory they used is returned to the main
                                  area so it can be used for other things.
                                  Programs always have to keep global variables
                                  and that means programs that require more
                                  memory than ones that used local variables.

                            When you ran the code, the program called the

                            assigned the value 'Peter Rabbit'. We know that if
                            you create or modify a variable
                            <strong><em>anywhere inside</em></strong> a
                            function, it becomes a local variable. This local
                            variable was then printed out and the function
                            exited. We are now back in the global scope of the
                            program. The last line of the function tries to
                            print the contents of the variable 'message' but an
                            error message is generated. This is because when we

                            inside that function disappeared. The program cannot

                            answer to this lies in what we said earlier, that in

                            When we run this code, what happens now? We set our
                            variable to hold 'Peter Rabbit' in the main program
                            so this is a global variable. Then we called the
                            function. When we entered the function, however, the
                            first thing we did was to set a variable called
                            'message' to hold 'Lily Bobtail'. According to what
                            we said earlier, if we create or change a variable
                            <strong><em>anywhere inside</em></strong> a
                            function, it becomes a local variable. We also said
                            that when you leave the function, all local
                            variables in that function disappear! So what should
                            get printed out? Try it and see. You should see that
                            'Lily Bobtail' gets printed first. When the function
                            exits, all local variables in that function
                            disappear. The program then gets to the last line of
                            the program and we print 'Peter Rabbit'. The local
                            variable called 'message' was a completely different
                            variable to the global variable called 'message'
                            even though they had the same name!

                            Now let's try and print the global variable and the
                            local variable from the function. Modify your code
                            to this:

                            What we have done is to set a global variable called
                            'message' to hold 'Peter Rabbit'. Then we called the
                            function. The first thing we did in the function was
                            to try and print the variable's contents. Then we
                            tried to change the variable so it holds 'Lily
                            Bobtail'. Finally, we tried to print the contents of
                            the variable again. What do you think would happen
                            now? Run the code and see. You should see that you
                            get an error message, telling you that you are
                            trying to use a variable before referencing it. What
                            is happening here?
                          </p>
                          <p class="NormalContent">
                            When the variable was set in the main program to
                            'Peter Rabbit', it was a global variable. When we
                            called the function, the first thing we tried to do
                            in the first line was to print the variable. But
                            there is a problem! According to what we have said a
                            few times now, if we try to create or change a
                            variable <strong><em>anywhere inside</em></strong> a
                            function, it becomes a local variable. So when we
                            changed the variable to 'Lily Bobtail' later on in
                            the function, that meant that the variable 'message'
                            inside the function was local. Now, even though we
                            did this <em><strong>after</strong> </em>the first
                            line in the function, the first line is a problem
                            because we are now trying to use a local variable
                            <strong><em>before</em> </strong>we have actually
                            created it. That's why an error message pops up,
                            telling us that we are trying to reference a
                            variable before assigning it.

                            If we want Python to use a global variable, we have
                            to explicitedly tell it to using the keyword
                            <strong><em>global</em></strong

                            what will get printed out before running it, to see
                            if your prediction was correct.

                            So now, we set the variable to hold 'Peter Rabbit'.
                            We then called the function and told the function to
                            use the global variable 'message'. It doesn't matter
                            that later on in the function, we change the value
                            that this variable holds - it doesn't ever become a
                            local variable in the function now because we told
                            the function it will always be global at the start
                            of the function, by using the keyword
                            <em><strong>global</strong></em
                            >. So now, 'Peter Rabbit' gets printed, then the
                            global variable is changed to 'Lily Bobtail'. Then
                            we print out the variable again, which prints 'Lily
                            Bobtail' and exit the function. The last line of the
                            program says print out the variable again, which of
                            course is global and still holds 'Lily Bobtail' now.
