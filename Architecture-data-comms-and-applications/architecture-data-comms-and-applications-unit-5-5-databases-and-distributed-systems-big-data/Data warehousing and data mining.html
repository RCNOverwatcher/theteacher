<h1 style="text-align: center;">Data warehousing and data mining&nbsp;</h1>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Data warehousing<br></strong>Data warehousing has been around since the 1990s. The idea behind data warehousing is that:</p>
 
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>historical data from past transactions and orders the company has had are separated out from the business</li>
<li>the data is re-organised in such a way as to allow it to be analysed</li>
<li>the newly structured data is then queried</li>
<li>the results of the query are reported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Data warehousing could be used as a predictive tool, to indicate what should be done in the future. However, the main use of data warehousing is not as a predictive tool but as a review tool, to monitor the effects of previous operational decisions made in the course of a business. For example, if Marks and Spencers decided to open stores in Asia, data could be collected as the&nbsp;stores opened and over the first few months. This could then be passed to a data warehouse. The wisdom of opening stores in Asia for the business as a whole could then be reviewed and conclusions backed up with statistical evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Data mining</strong><br>Data mining burst onto to the scene only a few years ago. Data mining is the term applied to the software technique that looks at a huge set of data and tries to find hidden trends in it. Data mining can be used to answer such questions as "Who is most likely to buy a book at Christmas?" and "Why are they more likely to buy a book at Christmas?" The most important thing to remember about the role of data mining is that it is predictive. It seeks to answer questions about the future. Compare this to the retrospective use of data warehousing. Data mining (and data warehousing) has become possible in the last few years for a number of reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Sophisticated software is now available.</li>
<li>Vast data storage is possible.</li>
<li>Vast processing power is available, for example using parallel processors.</li>
<li>The price of sophisticated hardware has fallen dramatically.</li>
<li>It is far easier to collect and process information because so much of a company's business is now digital.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
