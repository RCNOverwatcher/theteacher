                            A hotspot is a place where you can get Internet
                            access using wifi. Just as described in the section
                            on setting up a home network, you connect to a
                            wireless router, which has been set up by someone or
                            a company who has paid an Internet Service Provider
                            (ISP) for access to the Internet.&nbsp;
                          </p>

                            ><br />Hotspots come in various flavours. They can
                            be 'open' or 'unsecured'. You just need to be within
                            range of the wireless router (typically within 20
                            -30 metres), select it from the list of available
                            networks and you get connected without knowing a
                            password. This might sound great - free access but
                            it comes with a serious set of security risks. The
                            reason is that any data you send over an unsecured
                            network (a network where you don't have to enter a
                            password) is easily available for anyone with the
                            right software to grab - and the software to do this
                            is widely available on the Internet. So, for
                            example, any photos you send or any email accounts
                            you use can be easily seen by others. If you don't
                            have some software called a Firewall set up properly
                            on your connecting device, and you have 'file
                            sharing' still turned on in your settings, it is
                            also possible for someone to gain access to your
                            hard disk.&nbsp;Just by connecting to an open
                            network, you are opening up yourself to anyone else
                            on that network! In addition, if you use someone's
                            network without their permission, you may also be
                            breaking the law.&nbsp;

                            <strong>Secured hotspots</strong><br />Hotspots can
                            be free but password protected.&nbsp;You have to be
                            in range of the router and you need to know the
                            password. Sometimes in a cafe, these are simply
                            stuck to a wall for everyone to see and at other
                            times, you have to ask the owner for the name of the
                            network and the password. You then select the name
                            of the network from the list that appears on your
                            phone, tablet or laptop, for example, enter the
                            password and you are connected. Sometimes, access is
                            free but you have to set up an account, often using
                            a mobile phone number to verify the account. You
                            then get login and password details. Finally, there
                            are hotspots where you have to pay. You pay a
                            company a fee, usually by credit card, for so much
                            access time. When you are within range of the
                            company's router, you open up a browser, enter in a
                            login and password and you are connected, until your
                            time runs out! With all public networks, there is a
                            risk that your sensitive information can be grabbed
                            by someone else. The same advice applies here as for
                            with unsecured networks. You should always use a
                            Firewall and check that file sharing is disabled.
                            Many people advise never to do any sensitive
                            transactions over public networks e.g. never do
                            banking transactions, for example. Browsing using a
                            secure browser is also recommended, something

                            ><br />If you have two devices, one with 3g Internet
                            access e.g. a phone and one without e.g. a tablet
                            with just wifi, it is possible with many phones to
                            set up a hotspot. This is called 'tethering'.
                            Typically, you have to find a box to tick in your
                            phone's settings that tells the phone to turn
                            tethering on. You have to give your temporary
                            hotspot a name and sometimes a password or passcode,
                            although this is also sometimes automatically
                            generated for you. Anyone within range of your phone
                            can then see the name of your hotspot in their list
                            of available wireless networks. As long as they have
                            the password or passcode, they can get access to the
                            Internet using your phone! You need to be careful,
                            though. For one, they might use up your bandwidth
                            very quickly and you will have to pay for more. You
                            might also be breaking your phone
                            provider's&nbsp;terms and conditions. For example,
                            you may have a package that allows unlimited
                            Internet access but they will state that tethering
                            is not allowed to protect themselves from excessive
                            downloads. Your phone company may suspend your
                            account if it detects a sudden surge of data being
                            downloaded.
