                              techniques should be employed. Verification is the
                              process of checking that the sensible data entered
                              is actually the data you want! For example,
                              suppose you have a field NAME. You enter JONNS.
                              This is valid data. But when you double check it,
                              you realise that it should be JONES not JONNS. You
                              can then correct it. This is verification. There
                              are a number of verification methods in common
                              use.</span

                            commonly used when you set up or change a password.
                            You type in your password once, and then you type it
                            in a second time. If they both match, then your
                            password is accepted. If they don't match, even
                            though both entries are valid, it is rejected and
                            you are asked to try again.

                            <strong>Re-enter whole data files</strong><br />This
                            is used in data processing environments. Operator A
                            types in a set of paper-based orders, for example.
                            They are saved in a file, but not entered into the
                            database yet. When operator A has finished typing in
                            the orders, the paper-based orders are passed to
                            operator B. He re-types them all in. As operator B
                            types in an order, it is checked by the software to
                            see if what he has typed in is the same as what is
                            held on file, what operator A typed in. If they are
                            the same, then the order is entered into the
                            database. If they are not the same, then an error is
                            flagged up and the order needs to be carefully
                            checked. Flagging up can be done in a number of
                            ways. The keyboard could 'beep'. An error message
                            could be displayed, or all of the errors saved to
                            file and an error report printed out at the end of
                            data entry. Although this may seem a little
                            long-winded, it is an important method of
                            verification for critical data, such as for entering
                            in data from passport applications.

                            <strong>Reading back</strong><br />When you book a
                            holiday at a travel agent, you give them all of your
                            details and they type them into their computer. They
                            can verify that your details are correct simply by
                            reading them back to you and asking you if they're
                            correct! Sometimes, organisations need you to
                            confirm some details they have given you. In this
                            case, they may print out what you told them on a
                            form and then ask you to confirm the details, sign
                            and return it. If you have ever ordered anything
                            over the phone, then you will know that after you
                            have placed your order, the operator will read it
                            back and ask you to confirm that the order is
                            correct.

                            ><br />If you buy something on the Internet, you
                            will typically place an order by typing it into a
                            form. The order will then be prepared, possibly
                            rearranged and then displayed back to you on the
                            screen. You will be asked to check it carefully,
                            tick a CONFIRM button and then click a PROCEED
                            button (or variations of this procedure). This
                            procedure is another example of a verification
                            method. Indeed, it may be followed up with a
                            confirmation email, which is a further method of
                            verification.

                            ><br />It should be recognised that even with clever
                            validation and verification techniques in place, the
                            data entered into a database could still be
                            compromised. For example, it is possible that both
                            operators during validation entered in the same, but
                            wrong, data - perhaps they both misunderstood the
                            handwriting on the paper-based forms. It is possible
                            that both operators entered in the information on
                            the form, but the information on the form was wrong!
                            Even with the best methods of validation and
                            verification in place, data can still be
                            compromised.
