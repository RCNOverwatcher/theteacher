                            time. It is measured in terms of bits per second.

                            So 15 Kbytes is about 15 thousand bytes. 128 Mbytes
                            is about 128 million bytes. 20 Gbytes is about 20
                            thousand million bytes and so on. More often than
                            not, you don't need to know the exact number of
                            bytes, just an approximation! We will also assume a
                            byte has 8 bits of data. Strictly speaking, it may
                            have 8 bits but it can also be other values.
                            However, it is generally considered to have 8 bits
                            so that is the value we will always use.

                              is the same as 50 000 000 bytes approximately.
                              There are 8 bits per byte, so we transferred 400
                              000 000 bits. Three minutes is 3 * 60 seconds =

                              given by 400 000 000 divided by 180 which equals
