                            These are systems that ask a question, the answer
                            given by the user resulting in the knowledge base
                            being reduced in size. The classic example is a
                            medical diagnostic system.

                                  The first question might be 'Do you have
                                  constant headaches'? If the answer is 'Yes',
                                  then one portion of the knowledge base can be
                                  explored further. If the answer is 'No', then
                                  a different portion can be explored. Whatever
                                  the answer, the number of facts that will be
                                  looked at has been reduced.

                                  for people with headaches and sore throats. If
                                  it is 'No', then that will reduce the part of
                                  the knowledge base for people with headaches

                            Another example of this kind of system is a car
                            engine diagnostic system. When a car has a problem
                            with its engine, the problem can be diagnosed with
                            the help of an expert system. For example, the first
                            question might be 'Is there an oil leak'? If there
                            is, that would reduce the knowledge base to an area
                            that deals with problems involving oil leaks. If
                            there isn't, that would reduce the knowledge base to
                            an area that deals with problems not involving oil
                            leaks. Another question could be asked that further
                            reduces the knowledge base and so on, until the
                            number of possible causes of the problem are small
                            enough to report back to the user.

                            You have already seen a classic example of this type
                            of knowledge-based system, when you looked at
                            stock-control systems. In this kind of system, a
                            process is monitored by the software. When the
                            software detects particular situations, it gives
                            advice! In a stock control system in a shop, the
                            stock is constantly monitored: the amount of a
                            product in stock is decremented each time a customer
                            buys a product and has it scanned and it is
                            increased each time a delivery from the main
                            warehouse is received. The stock control system
                            'knows' that when a product falls below a certain
                            number, it should advise that a re-order take place.
                            Stock control systems can also be called
                            'decision-making' knowledge-based systems if they
                            are able to re-order automatically, without any
                            human intervention.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Another example is the safety systems fitted on
                            planes that help them avoid collisions. As the plane
                            flies, it scans ahead, checking that the path is
                            clear of other planes. If it does detect a plane
                            coming towards it, it should advise the pilot to
                            change course. Like stock control systems, these
                            systems can also be called 'decision-making
                            knowledge-based systems if they are able to
                            automatically change course to a safe route, without
                            human intervention.

                            In the section above, we saw that advice-giving
                            systems can also be called 'decision-making systems'
                            if they have enough information and the hardware and
                            software to allow them to actually take decisions
                            themselves, without human intervention. Many process
                            systems are both, because they enable a user to
                            select whether the system will be fully automated,
                            or will simply report and advise. An automated
                            share-selling expert system can be both.
                            Instructions can be given to the software that tell
                            it to automatically sell a share when it reaches a
                            certain price or it can be told to give a message to
                            the stockbroker, advising that the shares be sold.
                            The stockbroker can then review the situation,
                            discuss it with the owner of the shares and then
                            take action.

                            Software can never completely replace a human. For
                            one thing, a human has hunches and intuition. Some
                            might argue that removing these elements is a good
                            thing! Humans can, however, evaluate completely new
                            situations whereas an expert system is bound by
                            rigid rules and their current knowledge base.
                            Indeed, an expert system's knowledge base and rule
                            base must be kept up-to-date. This may seem
                            straightforward but if the expert system is in a
                            third world country, for example, it means that some
                            training will be needed so that somebody locally can
                            do this.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            To have an expert system means that the hardware and
                            software must be bought. Not only may this be a
                            problem in some situations, but careful thought
                            needs to be given to maintaining the hardware and
                            software - you don't want the system to stop being
                            used the moment there is a problem, simply because
                            nobody has been trained to maintain the system.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Expert systems may well be a wonderful substitute
                            for situations where it is impossible to recruit
                            highly trained people. They should also be much
                            cheaper than the equivalent human. It may simply not
                            be possible to pay for enough doctors to work in
                            third world countries, or it may not be possible to
                            recruit enough stockbrokers to work in a firm. There
                            are some dangers, though. It may be that people come
                            to rely too much on the power of the expert system!
                            These systems are never perfect. They may contain
                            software bugs. They may cause situations that have
                            not previously been considered. Expert systems that
                            automatically bought and sold shares around the
                            world nearly caused a stock market meltdown in the
                            1990s because they fed off each other and caused
                            each system to sell sell sell!
