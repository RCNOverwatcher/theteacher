<h1 style="text-align: center;">Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Assisted Manufacture (CAM)</h1>
<p><strong>Introduction<br></strong>CAD software is used to produce design drawings and diagrams on a computer. CAD software could be used to design a new&nbsp;chair, a football stadium, a microchip or a new wing mirror for a car. Traditionally, when something had to be designed, an&nbsp;engineer would sit down with some paper and produce a technical drawing. There are many advantages for the engineer and&nbsp;the company, however, in using CAD to produce the design.</p>

<li>Templates and old designs can be used to speed up the&nbsp;design process of new products.</li>
<li>Different designs can be relatively quickly tried out.</li>
<li>Colour, special effects, 3D views and animation of designs&nbsp;are possible to help everyone 'view' the design before it is&nbsp;built. This may be especially impressive when shown to the&nbsp;media or a customer.</li>
<li>It is possible to zoom in on particular areas of drawings.</li>
<li>CAD designs can be automatically linked to software that&nbsp;costs out the design, saving a lot of time in manual&nbsp;calculations and avoiding human error.</li>
<li>Designs can be stored on computer. Designs done on largepieces of paper have to be stored, archived and retrieved.&nbsp;This used to involve whole rooms and employing staff to&nbsp;look after storing drawings.</li>
<li>It is easier and takes up less space to backup drawings if&nbsp;they are held on computer.</li>
<li>Designs can be emailed quickly to other departments&nbsp;anywhere in the world. This is useful because it removes&nbsp;delays created by the post and aids teamwork between&nbsp;members in different parts of the world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When designs are done on computer using CAD software, some consideration should be given to the best hardware to use. For&nbsp;example, a large VDU will help to see more of a particular diagram and will allow better use to be made of higher resolution&nbsp;screens, a plotter will allow very large drawings to be produced to a high degree of accuracy and a graphics tablet may be&nbsp;useful because it allows the designer to draw in a more natural way.</p>
<p><strong>Computer Assisted Manufacture (CAM)</strong><br>We have already said that one advantage of CAD designs is that they can be used to automatically cost out the design. It is&nbsp;possible, however, to link the design done on a computer using CAD software to the actual machines that produce the product!&nbsp;When a design is completed, details of the design can be converted into instructions for the machines that produce the product.&nbsp;The machines can then start producing the product without a human having to set them up. This saves time and reduces the&nbsp;number of staff needed in the manufacturing process. If any modifications are made in the design using CAD, these can simply&nbsp;be passed to the machines and the changes will be made automatically - the machines don't have to be stopped. This improves&nbsp;the number of products made and so improves efficiency. When production is linked to CAD as described above, it is known as&nbsp;Computer Assisted Manufacturing, or CAM. CAM is a term used not only to link the design process with the manufacturing&nbsp;process. It also encompasses the management of the supply of components needed to manufacture the products and the factory&nbsp;planning process, to ensure that production and output are maximised.</p>
<p><strong>3D printing</strong><br>Just as CAD systems can be linked up to CAD, they can also be directly linked up to 3D printers. When a design has been completed on a CAD system, the file can be sent directly to a 3D printer, which can print it out immediately. The designers can then see a product immediately in their hands, or at least see a prototype. If they had a second company or a customer on the other side of the world, they could email the file over, to be printed out there on a 3D printer so they could immediately see what was designed. Certain products will no doubt be available for download to customers to print out in the near future, in much the same way as you can buy online, download and then listen to a song at home today.</p>
