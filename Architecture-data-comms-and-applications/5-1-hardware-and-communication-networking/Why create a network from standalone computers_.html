                            <strong>Introduction</strong><br />A stand-alone PC
                            is one which is not connected to any other PC,
                            either by using a cable or wirelessly. A network is
                            where more than one computer is connected together.
                            We say it is a 'Local Area Network' or LAN if the
                            computers are relatively close to each other,
                            perhaps in the same room, building or group of
                            buildings on the same site. They are a 'Wide Area
                            Network' is the computers are spread out over a
                            geographical area, perhaps in the same town, or
                            across a country or across the world, as the
                            Internet is.

                            ><br />There are quite a few advantages to
                            networking computers and a small number of
                            disadvantages. The advantages of a network can be
                            summarised in the diagram below.

                                  Computers that are connected together can
                                  communicate with each other. Stand-alone
                                  machines can't.
                                </li>

                                  Users on a network can easily share resources
                                  such as printers, scanners and modems. This
                                  means that a company doesn't have to buy so
                                  much equipment and users do not waste time
                                  moving files to different machines so they can
                                  use a piece of equipment that is only
                                  available on a particular PC.
                                </li>

                                  Users on a network can share data. For
                                  example, a team might be working on a project.
                                  They can all access and work on the same files
                                  easily without having first to back them up on
                                  floppy disks, for example, and then transport
                                  them to the next team member and then reload
                                  the files.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  New software need only be added once. It can
                                  then be distributed to all other PCs
                                  automatically.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  When data files are backed up they only need
                                  to be backed-up once, centrally, at the
                                  server. With stand-alone machines, you would
                                  have to back up the files on every machine.
                                  This would be very time-consuming!
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Users can retrieve and work on files from any
                                  machine on a network. If one machine is being
                                  used or breaks down, you simply move to a
                                  different machine!

                                  Networks can be managed. This means a network
                                  manager is able through the network software
                                  to control who can access the network, when
                                  they can access it, and what files and
                                  software and hardware they are allowed to use.
                                  An audit trail of each user can be built up so
                                  that projects can be more efficiently costed,
                                  for example, by keeping track of what
                                  printouts are done in connection with what
                                  project. Users, knowing that their activities
                                  are being monitored, will also be encouraged
                                  to stay on-task and not waste the
                                  organisation's time!

                                  Security can be centrally managed by the
                                  network manager. They can add patches
                                  centrally, ensure virus patterns are
                                  up-to-date centrally and so on.

                                  It costs more money to build a network than it
                                  does stand-alone machines. This is because you
                                  have to buy network cards, interconnections, a
                                  server and a Network Operating System.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  There is an additional support cost that is
                                  not insignificant. Networks are more
                                  complicated than sets of stand-alone machines.
                                  They need specialist knowledge to set them up
                                  and maintain them as well as time to maintain
                                  them. To do this, you would need to employ
                                  somebody with network management skills,
                                  usually a network manager.

                                  Networks have machines in different locations,
                                  each of which potentially could be used to
                                  gain access to the server's hard disk and the
                                  data stored on it. This is a security headache
                                  and the need to protect data on a network from
                                  hackers adds an extra degree of complexity to
                                  a network that doesn't exist with standalone
                                  machines.

                                  If the server on a client-server network goes
                                  down, the whole network will be out of action.
                                  It is also possible for one faulty machine on
                                  a network to cause other machines on the
                                  network to stop working. In addition, if the
                                  cables on a network fail, problems on either
                                  individual machines or on the whole network
                                  may occur.

                                  Viruses and other types of malware can spread
                                  very quickly across networks.
