                            This is a method of sending data over networks. When
                            an email message is sent across a network such as
                            the Internet, the email is split up into packets of
                            data, each of equal size. To each packet is attached
                            some extra information. This includes:
                          </p>

                                  The <strong class="strong">address</strong> of
                                  the sender of the packet.

                            When the message is sent, the packets each try to
                            find the best path to the destination. They
                            invariably split up and go by different routes. The
                            packets are passed on from one network to the next,
                            ever forward to the final destination. This means
                            that the network is being used efficiently because
                            no single path is being tied up with just one
                            message as it would do in a phone call using circuit
                            switching, for example (no engaged tones). In
                            addition, you are not relying heavily on one
                            particular communication route. With phones, you are
                            relying on the line working. You cannot phone your
                            friend if their line is not working because they
                            only have one circuit to their actual phone. With
                            packet switching there may be a delay while each of
                            the packets reaches their destination address. This
                            can happen if, for example, a computer receives lots
                            of packets at once. It will have to queue them all
                            up and then deal with them in turn.

                            >This is a method of communication that sets up a
                            communications channel just before a message is sent
                            and then keeps that channel open exclusively for the
                            entire duration of that transmission. The
                            communication channel is released for other messages
                            only when the transmission is totally finished. The
                            classic example is the telephone system, when you
                            make a call.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            A phone call is immediate using circuit switching.
                            There is no waiting for packets of information. You
                            just talk and listen and communication is full
                            duplex - you can speak and hear at the same time!
                            However, this kind of transmission relies heavily on
                            a particular channel being available (not engaged).
                            Remember, with circuit switching, the communications
                            channel is reserved for the entire transmission of a
                            message and so nobody else can use it. In addition,
                            security may be compromised because the whole of a
                            message is being sent at once. While data security
                            is still an issue with packet switching, a packet
                            that is intercepted on its own may not compromise
                            the whole message. It would be prudent to use data
                            encryption with packet switching if the data was
                            sensitive. Another issue with circuit switching,
                            certainly in older parts of the telephone network
                            (known as the 'PSTN') is that it involves setting up
                            transmission channels by opening and closing
                            electro-mechanical switches. This act causes
                            electrical interference, which can corrupt data
                            (causing interference) if adequate recautions are
                            not taken.
