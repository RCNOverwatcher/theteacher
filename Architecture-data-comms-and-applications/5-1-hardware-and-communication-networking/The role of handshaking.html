<h1 style="text-align: center;">The role of handshaking</h1>
<p><strong><span class="NormalContentHeading">Introduction</span></strong><br><span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">Before two devices can communicate and transfer data between them, they must ensure they are both ready to&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">communicate. Then, when they are in the middle of sending and receiving data, they must constantly check that each other is ready. For example, a printer must be able to say to a computer, 'stop sending data because I have a paper jam, or I've run out of paper'.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">How they do this is referred to as 'handshaking'. Handshaking is the exchange of signals between devices to check that they are both ready and able to send and receive data. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">There are two types of handshaking that could be used. The first is&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">hardware handshaking and the second method is software handshaking.</span></p>
 
<p><span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">Consider the following tyoical situation. Both devices can send and receive data, and at the same time. This is called 'duplex data transmission'.</span></p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/ae2ba698-9d1f-4aeb-8592-0640fda2ebbahandshaking.gif" alt="handshaking"><br><strong>Sending data from the computer to the modem using hardware handshaking</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1) If the the computer wants to send data to the modem and is ready to do so, it sends the modem an RTS&nbsp;signal ('Request To Send') and a DTS signal ('Data Terminal Ready'). Each of these signals has its own wire in the cable &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that connects the two devices.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2) When the modem sees an RTS signal, it sends a DSR (Data Set Ready) signal to the computer to tell it that it is switched on.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3) The modem then sends a CTS signal. This is a 'Clear To Send' signal that indicates to the computer that it is okay&nbsp;to send data.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4) The data is then sent one bit at a time down the TD wire, or the Transmit Data wire in the cable.</p>
<p><strong>Sending data from the modem to the computer&nbsp;<strong style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">using hardware handshaking</strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1) The computer sends the modem a DTR signal. This is a Data Terminal Ready signal on its own wire and signals to&nbsp;the modem that the computer is ready to receive data.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2) The modem sends a DSR signal to the computer when it sees a DTR signal. This is a Data Set Ready signal and&nbsp;tells the computer that the modem is connected and ready to send data.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3) The modem then sends data to the computer on the RD wire, or 'Receive Data' wire, one bit at a time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Software handshaking (XON / XOFF)</strong><br>Rather than having lots of extra wires in a cable (one for the DTS signal, a different one for the RTS signal, and so on),there is nothing stopping you using software handshaking for data communication. Special ASCII codes are sent between&nbsp;devices to start and stop data transmission. In fact, you only need two special codes:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;‘Start the data transmission’ - X-ON<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;‘Pause the data transmission’ - X-OFF.</p>
<p>Having fewer wires to worry about is nice but it is not all good news. You need to send the special characters, which may mean&nbsp;that you have to send more data than if you used hardware handshaking!</p>
