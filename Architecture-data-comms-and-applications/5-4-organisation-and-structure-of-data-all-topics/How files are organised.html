<h1 style="text-align: center;">How files are organised</h1>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>Files used in data processing and tables used in databases are essentially the same thing. They both hold records about something which you need to keep information about. A record is simply a collection of pieces of information called 'attributes'. There are lots of different technical words and phrases (also known as 'jargon') we should know and we should also be aware of the synonyms (different words for the same thing, like 'pupil' and 'student').</p>
 
<p><strong>Entities and attributes</strong><br>An ‘entity’ is the term used to describe something we keep information about. Attributes are the pieces of information we keep about an entity. For example, we might have a pupil database. The entity here is 'Pupil' because that is what we keep information about. The attributes are the pieces of information about a pupil, such as their first name, surname, date of birth, form group and so on. In a library, you might keep information about books. 'Book' would be the entity and name of book, author, ISBN number and so on would be the attributes.</p>
<p><strong>Tables</strong><br>Once we have identified an entity, and we know what attributes we want to keep about each entity, we can then store the actual pieces of information about each entity. We can think of a database that holds entities and attributes as a table. Consider this example. It holds records about dogs.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>All of the details about one actual dog is called a 'record'.</li>
<li>The records correspond to a row in a table.</li>
<li>All the pieces of information about the dogs, the 'attributes', are held in the columns of the table.</li>
<li>Another name for an attribute is a 'field'.</li>
<li>The headings in a column tell you what the attribute is in that column. They are the 'field names' and usually make up the first row in a table.</li>
<li>The individual pieces of information, the actual pieces of data, are called 'data items'.</li>
<li>All of the records together, all of the rows, form a 'table'.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Files and databases</strong><br>Another name for a table of records is a 'file'. A database can be defined as one or more files. You can have a simple database, with all the information held in just one table.You could also have a bigger database, where all of the entities have been logically split up into different tables. For example, a school database might have one table for students, another for staff, another for all the information about different qualifications, a table for records about each room and the facilities in each room and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Primary key (key field)</strong><br>There is one field that we haven't mentioned yet, known as the 'primary key' or 'key field'. This is a special field. It is always different for every record in the database. It is always unique. The problem is that we might have two dogs called 'Bongo' in the database, or two dogs born on the same day, or two dogs owned by the same owner. We need a way of making sure that we can always refer to one individual record. In your school's database, there might be two students with the same name but their primary key (their student identity number) will always be different. When you pass your driving test, you are given a unique driving licence number. When you visit hospital, you will be given a unique patient number. You will have a unique National Insurance number one day, a unique tax number and so on.</p>
<p>The usual way to make sure every record always has one field that is unique is to ensure that each record has an identity number of some description. That's why we have a field called ID in our dogs table.</p>
