                            The common numbering system we use in our daily
                            lives is called the 'denary' system, or counting
                            using 'base 10'. In practice, what this means is
                            that we count using 10 different digits:
                            0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9. We have also seen that it
                            isn't just a digit that is important. It is the
                            <strong><em>position</em> </strong>of the digit
                            relative to the other digits in a number that is
                            also important. For example, consider the digit 6.
                            It is worth one amount if it is on its own. It is
                            worth a different amount in 63, and worth a lot more
                            in 6324, and a lot less in 54.68. In all these
                            examples, the amount that the digit is worth is
                            determined by where exactly it is in relation to the
                            other digits in the number.
                          </p>

                            Let's look at a number, for example 658. How do we
                            know how much this number is 'worth'? We know
                            because without thinking about it, we judge the
                            digits that make up the number relative to the other
                            digits! When you were at primary school, you may
                            have been helped to learn your numbers by writing
                            down column headings for a particular number, just
                            so you could get used to the idea that position is
                            important. For example, consider what the number 658
                            means.

                            (probably) don't write down the headings anymore.
                            You don't need to because you're so used to counting
                            in base 10. Until you are experts in the other
                            counting systems you need to look at, you should get
                            into the habit of writing down the 'worth' of each
                            position.

                            Computers make heavy use of the binary counting
                            system. The reason for this is that the electronic
                            circuits that make up a computer are essentially
                            made up of millions and millions of switches. The
                            switches can have two states - on or off. The actual
                            position of any particular switch relative to other
                            switches is also very important. (In fact, a switch
                            can have three states: on, off and ‘not connected’,
                            but that is beyond this book)!

                            The base 10 system (denary) uses 10 digits, zero to
                            nine. The base 2 system (binary) uses just 2 digits
                            (or 'bits') zero and one. We are going to start our
                            work by using groups of 8 bits, known as a ‘byte’.

                            byte is also important. The bit on the left is
                            'worth' far more than the bit on the right, for
                            example. This is for no other reason than it is the
                            way I have defined it.

                            Incidentally, you can see when I used the denary
                            system, there was a pattern to working out the
                            'worth' of each position. It went 10<sup>3</sup>,
                            10<sup>2</sup>, 10<sup>1</sup>,
                            10<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;and so on. (Any number to the
                            power of zero is one)! There is a similar pattern
                            when using base 2.

                            set of throws in a darts match! The minimum score we
                            need to hold is zero. The maximum is 180, and the
                            score will always be an integer, a whole number i.e.
                            you cannot score 34.5, for example. So now, to
                            represent 180, I would set the bits as shown on the
                            next page. (Note: when I talk about 'setting a bit'
                            I mean that it is made a 'one'. When I talk about

                            Computers are digital devices! If we had to work in
                            binary all the time, we would soon go mad! The
                            numbers are very long. It takes a while to work them
                            out and it isn't very convenient. There are other
                            numbering systems around that, because of their very
                            close relationship with binary, make them highly
                            suitable. Programmers will sometimes work in binary,
                            for example, but may far more often work in Hex!
                            Using Hex, we can group 4 bits together, to create a
                            'Hex code'. It is a lot easier to remember 4 Hex
                            numbers than 16 bits, for example! To see how this
                            system works, we need to start at the beginning!

                            How does the hexadecimal system work? The first
                            thing to note is that there are 16 'numbers' in this
                            system: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F. It may well
                            seem a little odd using letters to represent
                            numbers: 10=A, 11=B, 12=C, 13=D, 14=E, 15=F. With a
                            little practice, you will see what an excellent
                            system this is.

                            Just to remind you, to show what system is being
                            used when you write down a number, it is common to
                            use a subscript. So for example: 34<sub>10</sub>
                            means (3 x 10) + (4 x 1) whereas 34<sub>16</sub>
                            means (3 x 16) + (4 x 1)

                            As you know, when we write down numbers in our daily
                            life, we omit the subscript because we assume that
                            every one is using base 10. Sometimes, especially in
                            computer circles, it is a dangerous assumption to
                            make! If there is any doubt, then add a subscript!
                            When doing exam questions, always use a subscript,
                            just to show how clever you are!

                            you've done a few of them. You have to think a
                            little bit harder going the other way, from denary
                            to Hex. But there is a better way! If you remember,
                            we said that Hex and binary were very closely
                            related. As long as we can do binary to denary
                            conversion off the top of our heads, there is a
                            method for converting denary to Hex, and also back
                            again, very quickly. See if you can follow this
                            example. We are going to convert 125<sub>10</sub>
                            into a Hex number.

                            once you've done a few examples.

                                numbering system in computing. Octal, or the
                                base 8 system, uses 8 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
                                6 and 7. We have already seen that a digit's
                                worth depends on what position it is in relative
                                to the other digits.</span

                            >So far, we have stored numbers as binary, or in a
                            form very close to binary such as Octal and Hex.
                            This is very useful, and allows us to do maths on
                            the codes. In some applications, however, it is more
                            important to maintain a link between the position of
                            a decimal number and the way it is represented in
                            binary. It is useful where you need to store the
                            digits as data type 'character', where you don't do
                            any actual processing on them. An example is a coded
                            sales number.

                            A mail order company uses codes such as 24361885.
                            This isn't a number! It's a code made up of
                            characters (not 'numbers' in the sense of 'an
                            amount'). The first two characters might be a
                            product code, the third character might be a country
                            code and so on. Now you never 'add' or 'subtract' or
                            do any other maths operations on these codes, but
                            you might need to strip out parts of the code at
                            some point. For example, if you needed to know the
                            country, you would strip out the country character.
                            You could store each character as a byte. If you did
                            this you would need 8 bytes in total (because there
                            are 8 characters). But that is inefficient compared
                            to storing it using BCD. In this system, each
                            character would only need 4 bits, so you would only
                            need a total of 4 bytes to store 8 characters.

                            Another example of the use of BCD is when you need
                            to store the codes that get displayed on a
                            calculator. Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) is a method
                            for doing just this. You can store each separate
                            digit in a number as a 4 bit code. Each one can then
                            be sent to each part of the display unit that
                            displays just one digit. The BCD can be quickly
                            decoded and turned into instructions that tell the
                            calculator which digit to display. BCD conversion is
                            very straightforward!!

                            It doesn't matter how many denary digits you have -
                            just convert each one into a 4 bit binary code!
                            Going from BCD to denary is equally straightforward.
                            For example, 0111 1001 1000 0000 0100 is the denary
                            number 79804. Isn't conversion really fast? After a
                            few of these, you hardly need to think!&nbsp;Notice
                            the very close relationship between the position of
                            each denary digit and the position of each 4-bit
                            group.
