                            They describe the situation when something becomes
                            too big or too small to be processed correctly or
                            stored in the space allocated to it correctly.

                            as a stack that has been set up to hold twenty data
                            items, and you try to add a twenty first data item,
                            this will cause a 'stack overflow' error. This is
                            because the data structure is not big enough to hold
                            the extra piece of data you are trying to add to
                            it.&nbsp;

                            Imagine you are trying to add two 8-bit numbers in
                            an 8-bit computer. The largest number that a
                            register or memory location can hold is 8 bits. What
                            happens when you add these two numbers?

                              only hold 8 bits, that extra bit on the far left
                              causes an 'overflow' error. This signals that the
                              result was too big to hold in 8 bits. The sum we
                              just did was 240 + 144, which equals 384. The
                              largest number that 8 bits can hold is 1111 1111
                              or 255 so having an overflow error makes sense
                              with this calculation.&nbsp;</span

                              >Imagine you want to store a floating point number
                              in a programming language. A floating point number
                              has a mantissa and an exponent. If you wanted to
                              store 5.5 in a byte (8 bits) as a normalised
                              floating point number using 5 places for the
                              mantissa and 3 places for the exponent, we would
                              convert 5.5 into a fixed point number first to get
                              101.1 but this has to begin with 0.1 to be
                              normalised, so we move the decimal point to the
                              left three (011) places, to get 0.1011. To get the
                              floating point number, we therefore have 01011011.

                              mantissa and the exponent are positive. The
                              mantissa must begin with 01 so is 01111 and the
                              exponent is a 2s complement number so the largest
                              number is 011. The maximum value is therefore
                              01111011 or &nbsp;7.5 in decimal. If we try to
                              hold a value bigger than that, we will get an
                              overflow error.</span

                              the exponent is the largest negative number. The
                              smallest positive (normalised) mantissa is 01000
                              and the largest negative exponent is 100 (-4 as a
                              2s complement number). The smallest positive
                              number we can hold is therefore 0.03125. If we
                              tried to hold 0.02234 for example, we would get an

                              register is a register in a CPU. In a 16-bit
                              computer, there are clearly 16 bits in the status
                              register. Each of these bits gets set (made a one)
                              or reset (made a zero) after every single
                              operation that the CPU does. One of those bits is
                              used to indicate if an overflow happened in the
                              last calculation that the CPU did. Another one is
                              used to indicate if an underflow occured in the
                              last calculation that the CPU did. We can test
                              these bits by masking them out.

                              >For example, imagine the status register after a
                              calculation looked like this 0101 0011 0110 0000
                              and the overflow bit was bit 3 (the fourth from
                              the right - remember, we count from zero). To see
                              if an overflow error occured, we just have to AND
                              it with 0000 0000 0000 1000. If the bit was set
                              because there was an overflow, then this would
                              result in 0000 0000 0000 1000 and if there was no
                              overflow, we would get 0000 0000 0000 0000. We can
                              then test this result to see if it is zero or not
                              zero to decide what code to do next.</span
