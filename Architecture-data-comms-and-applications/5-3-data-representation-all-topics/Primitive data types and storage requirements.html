                            When a computer stores data in a program or an
                            application such as a database, it needs to know
                            what type of data it is. This is because different
                            data types require different amounts of storage
                            space. Before we look at storing data in both
                            fixed-size records and variable-sized records, we
                            need to look in a little more detail at the most
                            common data types. Some data types can be found in
                            most programming languages. Some data types may be
                            found in applications such as Access.

                            An integer is a positive or negative whole number.
                            It has no fractional part. 5, -23 and 800 are
                            examples of integers while 5.7, -23.98 and 4.0 are
                            all real numbers because they have a fractional part
                            (even if the fractional part equals zero).
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            We have already seen some methods of storing
                            integers. We have seen the pure binary method of
                            representing integers, the sign and magnitude system
                            and the two's complement system. Using the pure
                            binary method, for example, we can represent whole
                            positive numbers between 0 and 255 if we use one
                            byte. That's because there are 256 unique
                            combinations of 8 bits. (0000 0000, 0000 0001, 0000
                            0010, 0000 0011, up to 1111 1111). One byte per
                            integer is of little use, however, if you need to
                            store numbers between 0 and 1000, for example. In
                            this case, two bytes would be needed. If we use two
                            bytes, we can represent integers between 0 and
                            65535.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            We know that pure binary is of no use if we want to
                            represent negative numbers. In this case, we could
                            use sign and magnitude if we just want to hold a
                            positive or negative number but don't need to do any
                            calculations on the numbers. If calculations on
                            positive or negative numbers are needed, then the
                            two's complement system should be selected. The key
                            questions to ask, then, when deciding on what binary
                            system to use to represent integers are:

                            Real numbers are numbers that have a fractional
                            part. For example 6.7 and -23.65 are real numbers
                            because they both have a fractional part. So far, we
                            have only looked at using a byte or two bytes to
                            represent integers. To represent real numbers in a
                            computer, we use a system called the
                            ‘floating-point’ system. How is this used to store a
                            real number?
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Consider this. The number 3547.54 is a real number.
                            It’s quite complex in that it has a whole part and a
                            fractional part. This number can also be represented
                            as 0.354754 x 104. The 0.354754 is known as the
                            ‘mantissa’ and the 4 is known as the ‘exponent’. If
                            I now store both the mantissa and the exponent, I
                            can store all the information I need to get back to
                            the original number. You may have come across this
                            way of representing numbers before in your maths
                            lessons. It’s known as ‘standard form’. If you want
                            to represent a real number then, you need to store
                            both the mantissa and the exponent. If you only used
                            one byte, the range and the accuracy of the numbers
                            you could store would be very limited. Real numbers
                            are therefore usually represented using either 2
                            bytes or 4 bytes. We will look in much more detail
                            at floating-point numbers and become expert in their
                            use later in the book!

                            Data type string is used to hold a string of any
                            characters (letters, numbers, special characters or
                            control characters) from the keyboard. We have
                            already seen that PCs use ASCII. Every character on
                            the keyboard has a unique binary code. To represent
                            each character requires 1 byte. If you were setting
                            up a database, for example, and you needed to store
                            the NAME of someone, you would define NAME to be a
                            data type ‘text’ because each name is made up of a
                            string of characters from the keyboard. But how many
                            characters should you allow? You need to think what
                            the longest name possible is and then add a bit,
                            just in case! For example, you might decide the
                            longest name you can think of is 20 characters long.
                            You need to allow 20 bytes of storage space for
                            every person's name, plus say an extra 5 for
                            'insurance' - just in case there is a slightly
                            longer name than you thought of! The amount of
                            storage space will quickly increase as the number of
                            NAMEs you store increases. There is a trick you can
                            use, however, to reduce the amount of space you
                            need.

                            Suppose you had a university database that stored
                            each NAME OF STUDENT at university and the TITLE OF
                            DEGREE they were doing. There are 100 different
                            degrees. If you had allowed 100 bytes for each TITLE
                            OF DEGREE and you had 10 000 students, you would
                            need 1 000 000 bytes to store their degrees.
                            However, if we coded up the titles of degrees (Maths
                            could be code MA, History of Art could be HA and so
                            on) then we would only need to store two bytes per
                            student for the title of degree. This method of
                            coding is a very useful way of reducing the amount
                            of storage space needed so long as there are a fixed
                            number of choices. It enables you to store lots of
                            pieces of information as a short code. It wouldn't
                            be a suitable method for NAME OF STUDENT, for
                            example, because there are an endless number of
                            possible names!
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            There are some other benefits of coding data. It
                            helps reduce the amount of time needed to enter in a
                            particular piece of data into a database. If the
                            codes are selected in a certain way, only authorised
                            people will know what they mean. Therefore the data
                            is slightly more secure. In addition, you can easily
                            apply validation rules to codes whereas applying
                            them to long text values is difficult.<br />

                            Data type ‘character’ is used to store just one
                            character from the keyboard. It is usually a letter
                            that is stored. For example, you might have in a
                            university database the LOCATION of a degree, what
                            campus it is taught on. You might have a choice of
                            four locations, which have been coded up into A, B,
                            C or D. However, any character, whether text,
                            number, special or control, can be stored in this
                            data type. A character needs one byte to store its
                            code if you are using the ASCII character set.
                            Things start to get a bit more complicated when you
                            start using other character sets. For example,
                            UNICODE can require up to 2 bytes if you are using
                            the UTF-16 version whereas UTF-32 uses 4 bytes per
                            character.

                            Any piece of information that can have two and only
                            two choices should be declared as data type Boolean.
                            For example, GENDER should be Boolean because there
                            are only two choices. ‘UK STUDENT?’ should be data
                            type Boolean because every student is either a UK
                            student, or not. Each Boolean data item needs one
                            bit to hold its value. For example, 'bit three'
                            could be set if the gender of the student is male
                            and reset if they are female. One byte can be used
                            to hold 8 Boolean data items because a byte is 8
                            bits 0000 0000 and each of those bits can be set to
                            1 (for TRUE) or reset to zero (for FALSE).

                            Date fields hold calendar dates! You need to decide,
                            however, what format you want the date to be in
                            because this affects how many bytes you need to
                            store the date. For example, if you want the date to
                            be DD/MM/YY (for example, 21/08/86) then you need 6
                            bytes. (You don't need to store the / symbol between
                            the numbers). If, however, you want the date in the
                            form DD/MM/YYYY (for example, 21/08/1986) then you
                            need 8 bytes.

                            It is worth mentioning that some pieces of data
                            aren't stored at all and so may not need to be
                            declared in the same way as pieces of data that are
                            stored. For example, calculated fields are used in
                            databases. These pieces of information are not
                            stored in a database or a program, but are
                            calculated at the time they are needed from pieces
                            of information that you have stored!

                            You can show how clever you are in any database
                            project by using a calculated field. A classic
                            example is where you store someone's DATE_OF_BIRTH
                            (data type DATE, 6 or 8 bytes) but you don't store
                            their age. (If you did store their age rather than
                            their date of birth, you would have to change each
                            record every single year!!) If you needed to display
                            someone's age, perhaps in a report, then you would
                            calculate it in the background with programming
                            code, using their DATE_OF_BIRTH information and the
                            computer’s internal date. The code to do this for
                            any programming language you are familiar with can
                            be found by searching the Internet.

                            Just because a number is made up of numbers doesn't
                            mean it is a number!! A telephone number, for
                            example, isn't a number in the sense that it's an
                            amount of something. You can't add a telephone
                            number to another telephone number to get a sum of
                            telephone numbers! A telephone number is better
                            described as a code. A number should only be
                            declared a data type number if you may need to do
                            calculations with it. If you don't ever need to do
                            calculations with it then it is safer to declare it
                            as text (or as a BCD, Binary Coded Decimal) number.
                            This is because leading zeros in integers are
                            removed but are not removed if the piece of data is
                            a data type text or BCD! Try, for example, typing in
                            00243 into a calculator. Either it won’t enter the
                            leading zeros or it removes them after you have
                            entered the number in. Telephone numbers sometimes
                            begin with a leading zero and so should be declared
                            as data type text or BCD. If you had a phone number
                            764880, you could use 6 bytes if the data type was
                            declared as a text. One byte would be used to
                            represent the 7. The second byte would be used to
                            represent the 6, and so on. You could, however, use
                            3 bytes to store the number as a BCD number in the
                            following way:
                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type: none">
                              <ul style="list-style-type: disc">

                                  You would store 0111 0110&nbsp; in the first
                                  byte. (The 7 would occupy the 4 bits on the
                                  left of the first byte and the 6 would occupy
                                  the 4 bits on the right of the first byte.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  You would store 0100 1000&nbsp; in the second
                                  byte. (The 4 would occupy the 4 bits on the
                                  left of this byte and the 8 would occupy the 4
                                  bits on the right of this byte).

                                  You would store 1000 0000&nbsp; in the second
                                  byte. (The 8 would occupy the 4 bits on the
                                  left of this byte and the 0 would occupy the 4
                                  bits on the right of this byte).
                                </li>
                              </ul>
                            </li>

                            There are other examples of ‘numbers’ that are
                            really codes - they are never 'added’, for example,
                            to other ‘numbers’. Consider a 6-digit product code
                            on an item of clothing in a shop that is made up
                            only of numbers. The numbers in the code mean
                            something - they are codes rather than numbers. For
                            example, the first number might show a type of
                            product, the next 2 numbers might be a 'country of
                            origin' code and the last three numbers might be the
                            manufacturer's ID. You may need to strip out these
                            numbers from a code, and the first number might also
                            be a zero. You will never need to add one code to
                            another, however, because this type of calculation
                            for this piece of data is a nonsense.&nbsp;
