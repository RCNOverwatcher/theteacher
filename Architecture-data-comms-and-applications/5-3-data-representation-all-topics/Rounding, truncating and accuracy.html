                            of giving it a value that is similar to the original
                            number but making it shorter. Truncation is where
                            you remove some of the least significant digits to
                            the right of the decimal place.

                            When you round a number, you are creating an
                            approximation of the original number. You are
                            introducing and error and getting a less accurate
                            number. But you are getting a smaller, easier to
                            handle number in return. Note that when you have to
                            round a number that is exactly half way through a
                            range, there are a number of different conventions
                            you could use. In example d) and e) above, we used
                            49 gets rounded down, 50 gets rounded up. Other
                            conventions exist e.g. rounding to an even digit.
                            For example, rounding 46.4150000 to decimal places
                            would give 46.42 (because the 1 was odd so had to be
                            rounded up) whereas&nbsp;<span
