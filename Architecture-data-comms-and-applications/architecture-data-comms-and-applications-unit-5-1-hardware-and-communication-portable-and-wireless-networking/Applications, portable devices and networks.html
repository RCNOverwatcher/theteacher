<h1 style="text-align: center;">Applications, portable devices and networks</h1>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>There are lots of different applications where you need to connect a portable device to a network. We have identified and described some typical examples below, although you will no doubt be able to find others with a little research.</p>
<p><strong>Email and social media<br></strong>If you want to check your email while you are out and about, e.g. at school or at work, or oyu want to check your social media accounts such as Facebook or Twitter or upload some photos to them, you will need to connect your phone to a network. This can be done using your phone's network provider and a 2G, 3G or 4G connection. You can also connect to WiFi, either using a public hotspot or the WiFi where you work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img style="margin: 10px; float: right;" src="images/05ef9a5e-b7b6-4459-a806-efc06a499a61gps.jpg" alt="gps">Navigation<br></strong>You can connect to the Global Positioning System, a satellite-based navigation system, to find out exactly where you are. This might be because you are out walking in some mountains, or you could be using a Sat Nav in a car, or flying a plane or sailing a boat. You might even be playing a world wide treasure hunting game called 'geocaching'. If you have never been geocaching before, you can set up a free account and start hunting for geocaches and other puzzles on the <a href="http://www.geocaching.com" target="_blank">www.geocaching.com</a>&nbsp;web site.</p>
<p>The GPS network is a system of 24 satellites, which circle the Earth twice a day in very precise orbits, transmitting information. This can be picked up by a portable GPS unit. If a GPS unit picks up at least three sets of signal information from three different satellites, it can calculate and display exactly where you are in the world using triangulation within about ten meters on a map and display your coordinates for you. Other information can also be worked out once a lock on at least three satellites has been made, for example, your speed of travel, your trip distance so far, your direction of travel, the time to the next sunrise and sunset and so on. Most smartphones have a GPS unit in them so that they can be used to find out where you are and display your position on a map such as Google Maps.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Orders in a restaurant or shop</strong><br>When you visit a restaurant, or some shops such as an Apple store, the person you are dealing with will take an order from you and enter it in directly into a portable device such as a specially designed handset or a mini iPad, for example. This is connected securely to a network, which can check the order, check availability, send requests to the kitchen or warehouse and send receipts. Payments can also be taken using a similar system. At a table in a restaurant, for example, you would typically hand over your credit card. The waiter would swipe the card then and there, you would be asked to type in your PIN number and then your card and receipt will be given back to you.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile salespeople</strong><br>Mobile salespeople will visit customers' premises. They will need to check stock, take orders, look up technical information, email people with queries and so on. To do this, they may need to connect their laptop or tablet to their employer's network. There are a number of different ways to do this. One way would be to use a WiFi dongle. This is a small device that plugs into a laptop's USB port and lets you access WiFi by using a mobile phone's 3G or 4G network.</p>
<p><strong>Transfering information</strong><br>Sometimes, people in the same room want to share information. They might want to swap photos or digital business cards, for example. There are a number of ways that this can be done. One way is to set up a Bluetooth connection. Two mobile phones are 'paired' temporarily by swapping a secret code. They can then transfer files to each other. Another way is for one of the users to set up their phone to be a portable WiFi hotspot. Others can then use this to send emails and files. Another method if you are using Apple devices is to drop files into an area called AirDrop on your device. Other Apple devices can then easily pick them up as long as they are withing about 30 feet.</p>
<p><strong><strong style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;"><img style="margin: 10px; float: left;" src="images/b76e0264-5cf3-4870-8d68-d20dc6325677uber.png" alt="uber" width="180" height="180">Taxi</strong><br style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;" ></strong><span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">An interesting recent application is the rise of applications that you can use to call a taxi from wherever you are. After downloading an application, you can view an online map showing you in real time where the nearest taxis are to you. You can get an estimate for any journey before you take it, request a taxi, pay for one using your application and get a receipt sent to you. You need to be connected to your phone network but that is all. One of the largest global companies is called Uber and&nbsp;</span><a style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;" href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank">you can read about them here</a><span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Online gaming and streaming music<br></strong>If you want to use a portable gaming device to play an online game or a game against other people across the Internet, or you want to listen to music or watch a film streamed across the Internet from a phone, you will need to make an Internet connection. These types of applications will typically require a lot of data to be sent so using a 3G connection may not give a very satisfactory experience. 4G may be better but best would be to make a WiFi connection.</p>
<p><strong>Secure connections</strong><br>If you are using a public WiFi network, anything you do is easily intercepted. This can pose a security risk, especially if you are using a public hotspot to send and receive financial or private information. You should always assume that all your communications and browsing habits over a public network are indeed public. If you want to keep your Internet sessions private, you need to avoid using any public hotspots at any time and only use your own, secure WiFi connection at home, or if you must use a public hotspot, always <a href="https://www.ipvanish.com/why-vpn.php" target="_blank">use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) such as this one</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
