                            <strong>Introduction</strong><br />The DBMS is a
                            complicated piece of software. It can provide many
                            functions.

                            ><br />The following list is not exhaustive but will
                            depend on the DBMS being used. I have tried to
                            include the ones that are commonly found in most
                            DBMSs.

                                  The DBMS includes software to allow the
                                  creation of tables, and links between tables.
                                  This includes defining what pieces of
                                  information (fields) will be stored, their
                                  data types, validation rules and properties.
                                  This information is stored in a 'data
                                  dictionary', which is just a place to store
                                  metadata (data about data).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  The DBMS stores information about primary keys
                                  (the unique field in each database), foreign
                                  keys (which fields will be used to link tables
                                  together) and secondary keys (which fields
                                  will be used to set up extra search indexes,
                                  to speed up searching).
                                </li>

                                  >&nbsp;which ensure that the data integrity is
                                  maintained. If a record in Table 1 refers to a
                                  record in Table 2, you don't want to be able
                                  to delete the record in Table 2. If you do,
                                  the record in Table 1 will then be referring
                                  to a record that doesn't exist. The data
                                  integrity of the system will not be
                                  maintained. What should happen to maintain
                                  data integrity is that the record in Table 1
                                  is deleted (or amended) and then the record in
                                  Table 2 is deleted.

                                  to set-up the forms and then you can switch
                                  into a design view to customise them.
