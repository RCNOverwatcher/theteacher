<h1 style="text-align: center;">An introduction to the role of the DBMS</h1>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>Databases can be large and have many users. If lots of different users access the same files on a database at the same time, problems can occur for the operating system. This problem can be overcome by using a 'Database Management System' (DBMS). This is a piece of software, which sits between the actual database of data and the applications that use the data.</p>
 
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/11bc20bb-7eda-47a3-a423-04122be8d604DBMS.GIF" alt="DBMS"></p>
<p><strong>What does the DBMS do</strong>?<br>The DBMS performs a number of very important jobs:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>it searches data in a database, adds new data and changes existing data</li>
<li>it provides an interface for the user, so complicated tasks can be carried out without the user ever needing to know how it was done.</li>
<li>it provides a range of maintenance functions, for example, making sure the data is stored properly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A DBMS software is made up of two main parts, the DDL and the DML.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/f9be9f8e-7871-45ff-995d-240752a2f8b1DDL.GIF" alt="DDL"></p>
<p><strong>The Data Definition Language (DDL)</strong><br>The Data Definition Language (DDL) is software used by the database designer to create and maintain the database. Using this software, tables of data can be defined, including defining the data, the data types and validation rules required.</p>
<p>It is also used to set-up database security. It can be used to set up each authorised user with a login and password and also to define what parts of the database each user will be able to access. You don't want a company's nurse accessing sensitive financial information on a database just as you don't want the company's accountant having access to everyone's health records! Each authorised user can see different parts of the same database. We say that each person has a 'view' of the database and setting up views for different users is an important part of setting up a database. The other important security feature that is provided is the ability to back-up the database and recover the data in the event of a serious problem.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Manipulation Language (DML)</strong><br>The DML software is software that is commonly used by the users of a database to access and update data. You can write programs that add, delete, modify or retrieve data, for example, using queries.</p>
<p><strong>Separation of data from applications</strong><br>We have already seen that the DBMS software sits between the actual database of data and the applications that run it. The data is separated from the applications that use it. (This wasn't always the case. At one time, the data and the programs that used the data were closely intertwined). Separation is desirable because:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>applications can be designed or modified without having to worry about the design of the database.</li>
<li>the underlying database design can be modified without worrying about the applications that use it.</li>
<li>different applications can be developed by different companies or individuals that make use of a single database.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Database Administrator (DBA)</strong><br>The Database Administrator is the job title given to the person, whose job it is to look after and manage the data in an organisation's database. They make sure that the structure of the data is appropriate to the needs of the users and that everything works as it should. They also make sure that the data is secured properly, by controlling who can access it and making sure it is backed-up properly.</p>
