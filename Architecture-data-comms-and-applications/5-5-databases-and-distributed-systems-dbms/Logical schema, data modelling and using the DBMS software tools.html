                            <strong>Introduction</strong><br />Databases must be
                            designed. DBMS's often have software that allow you
                            to design the database structure before it is
                            implemented.

                              >Data modelling is a 'high level' implementation
                              design of the database. This is achieved using
                              techniques such as Entity-Relationship Diagrams
                              and Jackson Structured Programming (JSP) diagrams.
                              When we say 'high level' what we mean is that it
                              gives the big picture without the detail. So for
                              example, E-R diagrams would show you what tables
                              you need and the relationships between them, but
                              not the data that was in each table or information
                              about queries, reports, forms and so on. A typical
                              E-R diagram looks like this:</span
                            >
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <img
                              style="vertical-align: middle"
                              src="images/e51872ef-2d6a-4e76-a250-9b7db3eeb7b5er.GIF"
                              alt="er"
                            />
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Once you have the high level E-R diagram, you can
                            use it to start designing each individual table in
                            the database model (see further below).
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            A JSP diagram is also a high level diagram. It gives
                            you information about how an entity (something in
                            your database) is created and destroyed, and all the
                            different things that can happen to it in the
                            database but not the detail about how these things
                            actually get initiated. A typical JSP diagram looks
                            like this:
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <img
                              style="vertical-align: middle"
                              src="images/3df6dfe5-5fab-421e-b4f5-1a12407776d7jsp.JPG"
                              alt="jsp"
                            />
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <strong>Logical schema<br /></strong>Logical schema
                            is an actual detailed specification and design of
                            your database. Again, this is part of the software
                            tools in a DBMS. Using the DBMS tools, you can set
                            up:
                          </p>

                                  what tables you need to have in your database

                                  what forms you need to enter in data and what
                                  they might look like

                                <li>
                                  what reports you might need and what they will
                                  look like
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                  what automated routines you might need using
                                  macros and modules

                                  what data you need in each table and the rules
                                  associated with each piece of data e.g. data
                                  type, validation rules.&nbsp;

                            ><br />Your teacher should ask you to design and
                            set-up a simple database so that you can get
                            experience using the developer tools. You will
                            probably use Access to do this. You should typically
                            follow the following steps:
                          </p>

                                  use the developer interface to specify what
                                  tables you want
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  define the relationships between the tables
