<h1 style="text-align: center;">Shift functions - introduction</h1>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong><span class="NormalContentHeading">Introduction</span></strong><br>A &nbsp;shift function moves bits to the left or the right. If the bits are shifted to the left, the left-most bit drops away and a zero is added to the right-most bit. If the bits are shifted to the right, then the right-most bit drops away and a zero is added to the left-most bit.</p>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong>Arithmetic shift examples</strong><br>15 as a byte in binary is 0000 1111 so if we shift all the bits to the left by one place, we get 0001 1110 or 30. If we shift 15 by two places to the left, we get 0011 1100 or 60. If we shift the bits in 15 three places to the left, we get 120. If we shift them four places to the left, we get 1111 0000 or 240. In Python, you use <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> to shift bits to the left. <strong>x &lt;&lt; y</strong> means shift the bits in x, y places to the left. x <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> y means shift the bits in the number x, y places to the right. Enter this Python code and see what happens:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>x = 15</strong><br><strong>print ('x is', x)</strong><br><strong>print ('x shifted one place to the left is', x &lt;&lt; 1)</strong><br><strong>print ('x shifted two places to the left is', x &lt;&lt; 2)</strong><br><strong>print ('x shifted three places to the left is', x &lt;&lt; 3)</strong><br><strong>print ('x shifted four places to the left is', x &lt;&lt; 4)</strong></p>
<p class="NormalContent">Now bit shift the bits in 15 to the right:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>x = 15</strong><br><strong>print ('x is', x)</strong><br><strong>print ('x shifted one place to the left is', x &gt;&gt; 1)</strong><br><strong>print ('x shifted two places to the left is', x &gt;&gt; 2)</strong><br><strong>print ('x shifted three places to the left is', x &gt;&gt; 3)</strong><br><strong>print ('x shifted four places to the left is', x &gt;&gt; 4)</strong></p>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong>Uses for bit shifts</strong><br>Did you notice a pattern when you shifted bits to the left? You should have seen that the original number was multiplied by two with each bit shift to the left. Moving the bits to the right is the same as dividing by two, although you can see the problem with rounding that occured in this particular example! If we wanted to divide 160 &nbsp;by 4, it can easily be done by shift the bits two places to the right i.e. in Python,</p>
<p class="NormalContent" style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>print ('160 divided by 4 is', 160 &gt;&gt; 2)</strong></p>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong>Logical bit operation examples</strong><br>We can use logical bit operations as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong>AND</strong><br>If we wanted to logically AND corresponding bits, then we can. For example, in Python,</p>
<p class="NormalContent" style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>print ('35 AND 2 is 0010 0011 AND 0000 0010 = ', 35 &amp; 2)</strong></p>
<p class="NormalContent">Each bit in the number 35 is ANDed with the corresponding bit in 2. According to the AND truth table, if both bits are a one, then the output is a one. If either bit is a zero, or both bits are a zero, then the output is a zero. This is a really useful way of applying a mask to a number to see if that bit has been set or not. In this case, we can apply the mask 0000 0010 to see if bit 1 (the second bit from the right as we count from zero) has been set.</p>
<p class="NormalContent" style="margin-top: 10px; line-height: 16.3636360168457px;"><strong>OR</strong><br>If we wanted to logically OR corresponding bits, then we can. For example, in Python,</p>
<p class="NormalContent" style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 16.3636360168457px;"><strong>print ('38 OR 19 is 0010 0110 OR 0001 0011 = ', &nbsp;38 | 19)</strong></p>
<p class="NormalContent" style="margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">This should give you the answer 55 because each bit in the number 38 is ORed with the corresponding bit in 19. According to the OR truth table, if either bit is a one, or both bits are a one, then the output is a one. If both bits are zero then the output is a zero.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="NormalContent" style="margin-top: 10px; line-height: 16.3636360168457px;"><strong>XOR</strong><br>XOR is useful in cryptology. If we wanted to logically XOR corresponding bits, then we can. For example, in Python,</p>
<p class="NormalContent" style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 16.3636360168457px;"><strong>print ('38 XOR 19 is 0010 0110 XOR 0001 0011 = ', &nbsp;38 ^ 19)</strong></p>
<p class="NormalContent" style="margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">This should give you the answer 53 because each bit in the number 38 is XORed with the corresponding bit in 19. According to the XOR truth table, if either bit is a one, then the output is a one. If both bits are one or both bits are zero then the output is a zero.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="NormalContent" style="margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 16.3636360168457px;"><strong>NOT</strong><br>You can get the complement of a number using a bitwaise operation. For example, the complement of 60 (0011 1100) is 1100 0011, which is a 2s complement number -128 + (64 + 2 + 1) = -61. We can this this in Python:</p>
<p class="NormalContent" style="margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 16.3636360168457px; margin-left: 30px;"><strong>print('The complement of 60 (0011 1100) is', ~60)</strong></p>
<p class="NormalContent" style="margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">Care needs to be taken with the complement. You need to remember that you are working with 2s complement numbers so the left-most digit is always going to be negative. For example, consider the complement of 147. You cannot represent this in 8 bits if it is a 2s complement number because the left most bit is negative <span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">(-128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1)</span>. You need nine bits. 147 is therefore 0 1001 0011 and the complement is 1 0110 1100 and again, this is a 2s complement number. This gives us -256 + (64 + 32 + 8 + 4) = -148.</p>
