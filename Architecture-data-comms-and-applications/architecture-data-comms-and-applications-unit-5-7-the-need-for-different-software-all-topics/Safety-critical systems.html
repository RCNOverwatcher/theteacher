<h1 style="text-align: center;">Safety-critical systems</h1>
<p><strong>Introduction<br></strong>Most control systems are time-critical. They need things to happen quickly. They also need things to happen reliably. So when, for example, a pilot steers a plane to the left, the plane should move to the left, quickly and every time! Applications such as&nbsp;these are written in purpose-designed software languages. ADA is one such example. It is a language that has its roots in Pascal. It has features that make it suitable for real-time applications. For example, it can deal with concurrent events and can&nbsp;be used in parallel processing architectures. Parallel processing might be needed if there is a lot of data and it cannot be processed within the required time by one processor. By using parallel processors, you can split the program up and run&nbsp;different parts of it at the same time. You can also use parallel processing to build into the system some backup systems (sometimes called ‘fail-safe systems’), in case the main one fails.</p>
<p><strong>Features of safety-critical systems</strong><br>It is possible to identify some features of real-time software as used in applications such as a plane's control systems.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>The output times are predictable within specified limits. This is important. When you use your computer at school and send something to print or start multi-tasking, then the speed that your computer will work at slows and slows unpredictably. In many real-time systems, it is important to be able to specify that XXX will happen within YYY milliseconds, regardless of whatever else is happening in the system, regardless of any interrupts that might occur.</li>
<li>Backup systems will have been incorporated into both the software and hardware. If ever something fails in the system, there will be a backup system ready to take over immediately.</li>
<li>The software is very fast! It will have been designed and written so that it runs at the optimum speed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Designing safety-critical systems is a highly specialised software engineering area, requiring knowledge and skills in such areas such as parallel programming and the ADA programming language.</p>
