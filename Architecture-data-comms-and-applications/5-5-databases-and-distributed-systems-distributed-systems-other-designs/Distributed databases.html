                            accessed via clients on the network is known as a
                            ‘client-server database’. Databases held on a server
                            like this are very secure because security methods
                            can be addressed at one point, the server. It is
                            also going to contain up-to-date data on it - after
                            all, there is only one database of data! The
                            consistency and the integrity of the data can be
                            maintained. Client-server databases have been around
                            a while. Their technology is understood. An example
                            of a client-server database would be the user names
                            and passwords held by on a school's server. When a
                            pupil requests to log in to the school network, the
                            request is sent to the server. The pupil's ID and
                            password is checked against the centrally-held
                            database of authorised users. The request is then
                            either accepted or rejected.

                            ><br />Client-server networks are excellent for
                            networks where the clients are physically close to
                            the server, for example, in a LAN. Where the clients
                            are physically far away from a server, then a
                            rethink needs to occur. This is because the time for
                            communication between clients and servers becomes
                            important. In addition, the availability of
                            processing time on the server cannot be guaranteed -
                            another client's request might be being processed.
                            Also, a client might only ever need to access a
                            small part of a database yet it can tie up access to
                            the whole database. This is inefficient. Look at the
                            following diagram.

                            /><br />Instead of having a centralised database,
                            the database can be distributed. There are a number
                            of ways to achieve this. One way is to take the
                            central database, make a copy of it and then split
                            up the copy. Each portion of the database is then
                            stored remotely on a local server, whilst the master
                            database remains on the central server. What each
                            portion actually comprises of will depend upon the
                            needs of the local users. Clients now access the
                            data held on their local server. The local server
                            will periodically access the master database, to
                            update it. This system brings some benefits to
                            users. Since the data for a particular local server
                            is now close to its clients, data access and
                            associated processing is speeded up. Access to the
                            data is now more reliable because the data is local
                            and availability of the data is improved because you
                            don't have to rely on remote communications. There
                            are some drawbacks, however. Distributed systems are
                            far more complex to manage compared to a
                            centralised, client-server networkThis means that
                            software and management costs are higher. Because
                            the data is spread over a number of different
                            servers, there are far more security issues than if
                            the database was in one place only. Keeping the
                            master database up-to-date is an issue that needs to
                            be addressed. For example, you don't want the data
                            in one local server to be different to the same data
                            held in the master database for too long. Also, you
                            don't want the data on a local server to be
                            different to the same data on other local servers
                            for too long either. When updating takes place
                            depends upon the application.

                            examples of Domain Names. The Internet has been
                            around for a long time now and there are literally
                            billions of Domain Names. Every day, new ones are
                            added and old ones become available. We have already
                            seen that the Domain Names system has been devised
                            so that humans, who understand words better than
                            numbers, can type in the address (Domain Name) of a
                            web site and that web site will pop up on the
                            screen. Of course, the real web site address isn't
                            actually a set of words like bbc.co.uk but is an IP
                            address, or Internet Protocol address. An example
                            looks like this: 143.66.43.16 You can look up your
                            own computer's IP address at many different sites
                            here:
                            <a href="http://www.whatismyip.com/"
                              >http://www.whatismyip.com/</a
                            >
                            <br />When you type in a web site, for example,
                            www.bbc.co.uk, that Domain Name gets sent to your
                            ISP. Your ISP has a special database kept in a
                            server known as the Domain Name Server, where it
                            keeps a database of Domain Names and their
                            corresponding IP addresses. It finds the
                            corresponding IP address and then uses it to locate
                            the server where the web site can be found. The site
                            is then downloaded to your computer.

                            There is a central database of Domain Names kept by
                            a company called Network Solutions. When you want to
                            register a Domain Name, you will probably contact an
                            Internet company that specialises in doing this,
                            such as this one:
                            <a href="http://www.reg-123.com"
                              >http://www.reg-123.com</a
                            >
                            You will type in your address and they will check
                            Network Solutions database. If it is available, you
                            will fill out a few details and pay a small fee. The
                            Domain Name is then yours to use for the period paid
                            for. Network Solutions maintains the master database
                            of all Domain Names. However, every ISP will want to
                            keep its own database of Domain Names. It doesn't
                            make sense for every ISP to keep every Domain Name
                            on its own DNS, however, but only those Domain Names
                            it is likely to need.

                                  other servers.

                                  database, but it knows other Domain Name
                                  Servers who may be able to help! It then
                                  contacts those other Domain Name Servers until
                                  one of them returns the IP address that was
                                  being looked for. Your DNS then uses it to
                                  request the web page for you.

                                  any DNS it has contacted. It reports that it
                                  doesn't exist.

                            That's how it works! The master database is kept by
                            Network Solutions. All the ISPs keep the part of the
                            master database that they think is most helpful to
                            them on their own DNS. Whenever you request a web
                            site, your own ISP's DNS tries to locate the IP
                            address first and if it can't find it, it enlists
                            the help of other Domain Name Servers.
