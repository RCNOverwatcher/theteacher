<h1 style="text-align: center;">Multiplexing and switching</h1>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>A multiplexer receives signals from lots of different sources and can then send the signals along a single communications channel to a single destination using a number of different techniques. At the receiving end, the signals are then separated back out. A switch can be used to make multiple connections between computers and other hardware, as well as being used to 'segment' a network, or split it up into areas, to make communications around a network more efficient.</p>

<p>Multiplexers are used because they greatly increase the amount of data that can be sent across a network in a particular amount of time. This subsequently reduces the cost of the infrastructure of a network.&nbsp;</p>

If two computers want to send information at exactly the same time, then there is a network collision, the packets are cancelled and they are resent, this time with a small gap between them. With lots of computers on a large network, there could be many collisions, which slows doen the network (because packets have to keep being resent). A switch is used to make multiple, <strong><em>simultaneous</em></strong> connections around a network. This reduces the number of network collisions that occur between packets and improves the efficiency of a network.</p>
