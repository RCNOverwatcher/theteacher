                            <strong>Q1.</strong>&nbsp;A virus is a software
                            program written by someone on a computer in a
                            programming language<br /><strong>Q2.</strong> An
                            email attachment is a file sent with an email
                            message.<br /><strong>Q3.</strong> A file extension
                            are the 3 letters that get attached to a file name
                            e.g. work.doc or everest.gif<br /><strong
                              >Q4.</strong
                            >&nbsp;Attackers can hide malicious attachments by
                            using double extensions, e.g. "answers.txt.lnk" or
                            "great_picture.gif.vbe". *.lnk, *.vbe and several
                            other extensions are usually hidden. The file names
                            you see are "answers.txt" or "great_picture.gif".
                            When you double-click on them, you install a virus
                            because .ink and .vbe can be used to do just
                            that.<br /><strong>Q5.</strong> Apart from emails,
                            sharing back-up devices is the other main way of
                            infecting computers with a virus.<br /><strong
                              >Q6.</strong
                            >&nbsp;The best advice is to don't open any email
                            attachments. The second best advice is to not open
                            attachments unless you can guarantee where they came
                            from, and this is far from easy.<br /><strong
                              >Q7.</strong
                            >&nbsp;The best advice to avoid catching a virus by
                            sharing storage devices is to not share storage
                            devices!<br /><strong>Q8.</strong> Free = AVG (free
                            version). Paid =Norton. There are many others that
                            can be found by searching the Internet.<br /><strong
                              >Q9.</strong

                            You update your virus patterns in your database
                            program regularly because thousands of new ones are
                            written every week.<br /><strong>Q10.</strong> You
                            set your virus program to update its own virus
                            patterns automatically because you might forget!

                              >Worms are programs that can spread themselves via
                              vulnerable network connections. They are
                              standalone programs, unlike viruses, which
                              ‘piggyback’ on other programs. In addition to
                              unauthorised use of systems and causing damage,
                              they can take up a lot of bandwidth as they spread
                              and slow networks right down. A particularly nasty
                              one called MSBlaster affected computers worldwide
                              in August 2003. It spread very quickly, hunting
                              for computers on the Internet without a firewall.
                              When it found one, it jumped into the computer
                              through the open communication port and infected
                              it without the user knowing - until their PC
                              closed down every time an Internet connection was
                              made!!</span

                              seemingly innocent programs. They, too, can cause
                              major problems for your computer. Malware is a
                              general term for any malicious program. A Firewall
                              is a program designed mainly to allow only
                              authorised users access to a network and to stop
                              worms and other malware from spreading across
                              networks.&nbsp;A Firewall, according to the
                              British Computing Society's 'A Glossary of
                              Computing Terms', "is a computing program used in
                              a large computing system to prevent external users
                              (even if authorised) getting access to the rest of
                              the system. Network users' access is restricted to
                              a small part of the system and the firewall
                              software prevents a user (including unauthorised
                              users) accessing data or executing any programs in
                              the rest of the system".&nbsp;Spyware is software
                              that installs itself on your computer and then
                              gathers information about passwords, what Internet
                              sites you visit and other confidential information
                              with the aim of transmitting it to criminals to
                              use. You can download spyware programs unwittingly
                              when you download open source or free applications
                              from the Internet so it is always a good idea to
                              only download software from trusted web sites.
                              There have even been instances of criminals
                              setting up sites that look like they are offering
                              free anti-spyware programs so you need to be
                              careful. Anti-spyware applications are available
                              from the Internet. One that has been around for a
                              long time is Ad-Aware.</span
