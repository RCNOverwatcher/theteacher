                            coursework. You not only want your work to be
                            brilliantly easy to read and navigate (by using
                            report-writing style), but it should look the
                            business and make the marker be impressed just by
                            looking at it! The simplest way you can ensure this
                            happens is to use a template.&nbsp;There is nothing
                            worse than a report of 50 pages that uses 5
                            different font styles and 10 different font sizes,
                            different layouts for paragraphs on different pages,
                            with headings that are sometimes in colour and
                            sometimes in black, that are sometimes underlined
                            and sometimes not, with page margins that are
                            different on different pages, with spacing out
                            between sections of writing different on different
                            pages and so on. If you pick up any book and flick
                            through a few pages, it will look brilliant because
                            there is a consistent style from each page to the
                            next one.

                            writing style, which is different to how you would
                            write an essay for English or History, for example.
                            This is a style that allows you to keep the amount
                            of writing down and allows a reader to quickly
                            skim-read the report and find what they want. There
                            are no universal rules about what this style is but
                            if you follow the rules below and note any
                            additional comments from your teachers and from the
                            Internet, your project will look fabulous. The key
                            is consistency throughput your work, and the key to
                            consistency is the use of templates (see
                            above).&nbsp;

                                  about what you are doing and will only
                                  concentrate on whether what you have written
                                  is clear and makes sense.

                            coursework! Get organised! Set up folders and
                            sub-folders for the project, organised like the mark
                            scheme. Save your work regularly. Back up your work
                            onto a pen drive every 30 minutes but remember, a
                            pen drive is a back-up device. You should always
                            have a copy of the main folders and files somewhere
                            else. I have taught many students over the years who
                            store their entire project on a pen drive, and then
                            they lost it or it failed on them! A pen drive
                            should only ever hold
                            <span style="text-decoration: underline"
                              >a second copy</span
                            >
                            of all of your work.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Always include the date in the file name. If you are
                            working on a document over many days or weeks, then
                            open it up and re-save it immediately with the date
                            in the file name. For example:
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Evaluation 21/09/15<br />Evaluation 22/09/15<br />Evaluation
                            26/09/15<br />Evaluation 30/09/15
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Then save it every 30 minutes you are working on it.
                            This is called 'version control' and this simple
                            organisational technique will enable you to find
                            anything you did in the past easily, as well as
                            providing you with a number of back-ups. This is
                            doubly importnat if you are working on the same
                            document from different computers. You need to know
                            the order that the versions of the document were
                            created in. Using the date in EVERY file you create
                            is the best way of doing this.

                            <strong>Prototype your proposed project</strong
                            ><br />Before you decide what project to do, design
                            and set-up a very simple prototype of it, with the
                            essential features. For example, if you are going to
                            have an adventure game, can you actually put
                            together a much simplified one over a weekend, with
                            just two characters, with their data, having a fight
                            and storing the results in a data structure? This
                            will help reassure you that the project you intend
                            to do with 30 different characters is realistic,
                            because it essentially involves just scaling up what
                            you have already done and adding a few bells and
                            whistles. This can be also provide you with some
                            evidence for section 4

                            <strong>Research</strong><br />Section 2 involves
                            researching similar projects and solutions. If you
                            can't find any, how does that affect your marks?
                            Your teacher will advise you, but one thing you
                            might do before finally selecting your project is to
                            make sure you can find similar open source projects
                            so that you can get ideas, examine the code, see the
                            data structures they used and so on. Selecting the
                            project wisely, by thinking about what you need to
                            do to get high marks before you actually make a
                            final decision on what project to choose is a
                            sure-fire recipe for success!&nbsp;Don't rush into
                            something that is too complex, too big so it takes
                            up all your time, or too obscure, so you can't find
                            what you need to get the highest marks for the
                            project.
