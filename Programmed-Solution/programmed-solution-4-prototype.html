                                write the code for some of the key parts of it

                            You can therefore easily justify producing an

                              so on. It's always good customer relations to
                              involve your customers at every stage of a
                              solution. Then you need to look at the solution
                              you are thinking of and make those parts which may
                              be complex, or do simpler versions of any complex
                              areas to prove the complex parts can be done, or
                              do one small solution to a problem that is
                              repeated many times. Any important functions
                              should form part of the prototype. You need to
                              prove (mainly to yourself but also other
                              stakeholders) that you have the knowledge and
                              skills to complete the project, and if you find
                              out you can't do some parts, now would be a great
                              time to simplify it. For example, if you have said
                              you need to search through data quickly using a
                              binary search, but can't actually write one or use
                              one from a library, then you need to think again,
                              perhaps using a different algorithm or simplifying
                              the problem so you don't have to search the
                              data.</span

                            for this is draw up a table with relevant headings.
                            You have to use realistic data in your prototype so
                            you need to state the data you will use and why you
                            will use that data. For example, you need to show
                            what data you will put into the data structures to
                            get them to work and why that particular data was
                            chosen, what data you will enter into the system to
                            use it and why that particular data was chosen, what
                            the results were when you ran key processes and so
                            on. You can provide evidence in the form of
                            annotated screendumps for this.<strong
