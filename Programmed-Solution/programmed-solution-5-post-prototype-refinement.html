<h1 class="ContentHeading" style="text-align: center;" align="center">Section 5 - Post-prototype refinement of design</h1>
<p><strong>The Eduqas specification says:</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>a) </strong>Obtain feedback from competent third parties.<br><strong>b)</strong> Refine designs in light of the evaluation of the prototype solution and feedback received from others.</p>
<p><strong>Things to consider doing:<br></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>i)&nbsp;</strong>Put a heading, <strong><em>5</em><em><strong>a</strong> Feedback</em></strong>.<strong><br>ii)</strong>&nbsp;You need to show evidence that other competent people have looked at your prototypes and made comments. The best way to do this might be through a planned interview. Prepare the questions in advance and be clear what you want to find out from them.<br><span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;"><strong>iii)</strong>&nbsp;Put a heading, <strong><em>5</em></strong></span><strong style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;"><em><strong>b</strong> Refined designs</em></strong><span style="line-height: 16.3636360168457px;">.</span><br><strong>iv)</strong>&nbsp;You will have found out many things by evaluating your prototype and getting user feedback. You may have decided to tweak input or output screens or reports. You may have decided to change some of the functionalitiy of your solution. You might have decided to alter the way you will do something, using a different data structure, for example. You now need to go back to your design documents and change them to reflect the modifications you have decided to do. Section 3 should show your original designs. This section should show the modifications you've made. You should make sure you show clearly the changes you've made and why you have made them.<strong><br></strong></p>
