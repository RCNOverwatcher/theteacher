                            >.<strong><br />ii)</strong>&nbsp;You need to design
                            all the different screens your user uses to enter
                            data. You then need to design all the screens your
                            user looks at to get information from. You then need
                            to design anything that comes out of the printer,
                            for example, reports. A great way to design the
                            screens is to start by drawing an outline 'map' of
                            the whole system, showing the different input and
                            output screens and reports and how they are
                            interconnected using the menus, sub-menus and
                            buttons. This will show someone clearly and on one
                            diagram how the whole system fits together. Then
                            start designing each screen individually. You
                            teacher will explain what you need to consider, but
                            consistency is very important; specify and use the
                            same fonts, colour scheme, spacing, layout, logo and
                            so on.&nbsp;<br /><span

                            structures you need and why you need them. What data
                            will they hold? Specify the data each will hold and
                            any validation rules that should apply to the data.
                            How will the data in each structure be accessed? The
                            easiest way to provide the evidence for this is draw
                            up a table with relevant headings.<br /><strong

                            identify those parts of your solution that need
                            coding, ideally in functions. You should then write
                            algorithms for each of those functions. You can use
                            whatever method is easiest for you to write the
                            agorithms, either pseudo-code or flow diagrams, for
                            example. You could start by simply writing out in
                            short English statements what you want the code for
                            a function to do, and then turn your statements into
                            something more akin to pseudo-code.&nbsp;
